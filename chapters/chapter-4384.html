        <p>:  Star  Constellation’s  Scheme</p>
<p>Just  as  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  about  to  be  trapped  by  the  Earth  Water  Wood   Fire  Four  Elements  Shifting  Formation,  a  rank  eight  Gu  Immortal  came   charging.</p>
<p>The  immortals  saw  the  person,  he  had  a  tall  and  fit  stature  with  a  high  nose   bridge,  there  were  golden  dragon  scales  on  his  body,  he  had  a  pair  of  topaz- like  dragon  pupils,  there  was  also  a  pair  of  golden  coral-like  dragon  horns   on  his  head.  He  looked  like  a  peerless  hero.</p>
<p>He  was  one  of  the  three  main  clones  of  Fang  Yuan,  dragonman  Wu  Shuai!</p>
<p>The  moment  Wu  Shuai  landed  in  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven,  two   Heavenly  Court  members,  Fairy  Maiden  Soul  and  Golden  Hooped  Great   Immortal,  arrived  closely  behind.</p>
<p>Wu  Shuai  had  been  fighting  with  them  before  but  had  not  completely  gotten   away  from  them.</p>
<p>Be  it  Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  Zhan  Bu  Du  or  Wu  Shuai,  they  had  all  made  a   breakthrough  in  their  strength.  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  strength  increased  to  the   level  of  Duke  Long  at  his  final  moments;  Zhan  Bu  Du  increased  the  number   of  Gu  worms  he  used  and  his  methods  became  more  comprehensive.  As  for   Wu  Shuai,  he  had  only  been  at  the  level  of  a  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortal,   but  now,  his  strength  surpassed  two  Heavenly  Court  rank  eights.</p>
<p>“If  this  continues,  Wu  Shuai  will  definitely  become  a  pseudo  venerable  one   day!”</p>
<p>“We  must  stop  Wu  Shuai,  don’t  let  him  save  Qi  Sea  Ancestor!!”</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortal  Jun  Shen  Guang  was  the  first  to  move,   followed  by  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy,  Duke  Mei,  and  Duke  Tong.</p>
<p>Wu  Shuai  was  attacked  by  six  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals,  his  situation   instantly  turning  dangerous.</p>
<p>He  could  only  choose  to  protect  himself  first;  countless  ants  wrapped   around  him  layer  upon  layer,  no  matter  how  many  were  destroyed,  they   would  be  replenished  immediately  as  if  they  were  infinitely  spawning.</p>
<p>“Open  up.”  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  sleeves  fluttered  wildly  as  a  thousand  feet  qi   current  rose.</p>
<p>The  four  Gu  Immortals  who  formed  the  Four  Elements  Shifting  Formation   had  a  great  change  in  their  expressions,  they  felt  they  were  like  mortals   lying  on  the  body  of  an  evil  dragon.</p>
<p>The  four  Gu  Immortals  maintained  the  formation  with  all  their  strength,   which  was  like  pitting  their  strength  against  Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  they   immediately  started  coughing  blood.</p>
<p>“Support  us.”  Bai  Cang  Shui  called  out.</p>
<p>“This  is  not  good!  Help  them.”</p>
<p>“We  can’t  lose  this  formation!”</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  Gu  Immortals  were  anxious.  Duke  Tong,  Duke  Mei,  and   other  immortals  surrounded  and  attacked  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  remained  unmoved,  he  defended  against  the  attacks  from   all  directions  with  a  composed  smile,  showing  a  calm  expression:  ”Let’s  see   how  long  you  can  defend  yourselves.”</p>
<p>Because  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  showed  his  power,  Wu  Shuai  obtained  a  much   needed  break.</p>
<p>He  pointed  his  hand,  the  large  group  of  army  ants  formed  into  the  shape  of  a   giant  eagle,  the  eagle  attacked  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  like  it  was   swooping  on  prey.</p>
<p>“Stop!”  Old  Immortal  Hua  Yu  was  seething  with  fury,  he  moved  forward  to   block,  but  all  his  methods  could  only  destroy  about  fifteen  percent  of  the   attack  and  were  helpless  against  the  remaining  eighty-five  percent.</p>
<p>The  whole  of  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  shook  intensely,  army  ants   were  tearing  and  gnawing  at  everything.  The  endless  gnawing  sounds  were   extremely  horrifying.</p>
<p>“Save  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven,  it  is  the  final  support  pillar  of  the   star  array  calculation  formation!”  Old  Immortal  Hua  Yu  shouted  in  grief.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  had  to  send  some  people  to  defend  Profound   Literature  grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>Like  this,  the  pressure  on  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  lessened  and  he  could  grasp  onto   battle  opportunities  more  easily.</p>
<p>Because  they  had  to  defend  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  Heavenly   Court  was  in  a  passive  situation  from  the  start.</p>
<p>This  disadvantage  was  exploited  viciously  by  Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones,  not   giving  the  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  any  chance  to  rest.</p>
<p>Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  was  already  in  a  ruined  state,  countless   beings  were  dead,  and  ants  roamed  everywhere.  Many  areas  were  even   drilled  through,  forming  tunnels  that  directly  led  from  Profound  Literature   grotto-heaven  to  the  outside.</p>
<p>But  these  were  not  routes  to  escape,  most  of  the  Gu  Masters  could  not  fly   and  escaping  the  grotto-heaven  meant  falling  to  their  deaths.  Even  the  Gu</p>
<p>Masters  were  in  this  situation,  not  to  mention  the  mortals,  animals,  and   plants.</p>
<p>“Xiao  Bai,  leave  with  my  daughter,  go!”  Imperial  Minister  Su  was  a  rank   seven  Gu  Immortal  of  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven.  Right  now,  he   was  defending  Li  Xiao  Bai  and  Su  Qi  Han  who  were  behind  him.</p>
<p>“No,  I  will  continue  to  fight!  This  is  my  home…”  Li  Xiao  Bai  was  already   heavily  injured,  his  voice  was  shaky,  blood  and  tears  flowed  as  he  spoke.</p>
<p>Imperial  Minister  Su  turned  around  and  glared  at  Li  Xiao  Bai:  ”Now  is  not   the  time  to  be  brave!  The  future  of  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  is   bleak,  but  you  are  our  hope.  The  people  inside  your  immortal  aperture  are   the  hope  of  continuing  the  legacy  of  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven!  Get   lost  now!”</p>
<p>“Father-in-law,  let’s  go  together!”  Li  Xiao  Bai  tugged  at  Imperial  Minister   Su.</p>
<p>Imperial  Minister  Su  shook  his  head  fiercely,  berating  furiously:  ”I  am  an   important  official  of  the  Imperial  Court  while  you  are  not.  You  can  leave   but  I  cannot.  The  dynasty  is  about  to  fall,  so  what  if  I  die?  Hahaha!”</p>
<p>Imperial  Minister  Su  laughed  loudly  as  he  pushed  Li  Xiao  Bai  outside  of   Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  and  then  flew  into  the  ant  groups,   engaging  in  a  fierce  battle.</p>
<p>“Father——!”  Su  Qi  Han  shouted  with  tears  flowing  down  her  face.  She   was  forcefully  dragged  by  Li  Xiao  Bai  and  left  through  the  hole  in  the   grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>But  just  as  the  two  was  about  to  escape  successfully,  a  strange  anomaly   occurred.</p>
<p>The  aperture  walls  of  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  crumbled  apart   instantly  and  were  replaced  by  huge  dark  brown  earth  walls  that  were  filled   with  bumps  and  holes.</p>
<p>There  were  countless  caves  and  passageways  in  the  earth  walls,  it  was  like  a   maze.</p>
<p>The  couple,  Li  Xiao  Bai  and  Su  Qi  Han,  almost  escaped  but  were  bounced   back  in  by  the  earth  walls.</p>
<p>“What  is  this?!”  Almost  all  the  Gu  Immortals  were  astonished.</p>
<p>“A  battlefield  killer  move…  it  is  actually  faster  than  my  rumor  cage!”  Zhou   Xiong  Xin’s  expression  changed.</p>
<p>Other  Heavenly  Court  members  also  had  unsightly  expressions.</p>
<p>They  had  yet  to  trap  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  completely,  when  they  discovered  that   they  were  the  ones  to  fall  into  a  battlefield  killer  move  first.</p>
<p>“That  is  Wu  Shuai’s  killer  move.”  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  laughed  to  himself.</p>
<p>Before  the  battle,  they  had  already  shared  information  about  their  respective   strength  and  methods.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  knew  this  was  Wu  Shuai’s  myriad  army  ant  nest  battlefield   killer  move.</p>
<p>Its  core  Immortal  Gu  was  rank  eight  ant  nest  Immortal  Gu.  This  move  used   a  blessed  land  or  grotto-heaven  as  the  base,  countless  army  ants  would  first   be  sent  to  corrode  the  blessed  land  or  grotto-heaven,  after  the  corrosion   reached  a  certain  point,  the  battlefield  would  activate.</p>
<p>Once  it  was  activated,  it  turned  the  crumbling  blessed  land  or  grotto-heaven   into  an  ant  nest  battlefield.  The  activation  process  was  extremely  fast,  but   the  prior  accumulation  took  a  long  time.</p>
<p>Thus,  the  fastest  battlefield  killer  move  was  still  rumor  cage.</p>
<p>After  Wu  Shuai  activated  the  battlefield  killer  move  myriad  army  ant  nest,   every  existence  in  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  was  trapped  in  this   battlefield.</p>
<p>He  immediately  sent  army  ants  to  attack  Gu  Immortals  everywhere.  At  the   same  time,  he  also  sent  many  ants  to  devour  the  resources  and  breed   rapidly.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  were  attacked  by  the  army  ants.   Looking  at  the  army  ants  that  worked  in  tandem  with  this  battlefield,  they   realized  that  Wu  Shuai  was  the  user  of  this  battlefield  killer  move!</p>
<p>“We  underestimated  him.”</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan’s  three  main  clones  have  many  new  methods  and  almost  all   their  killer  moves  have  been  modified.  What  about  Fang  Yuan’s  main   body?”</p>
<p>“It  is  not  the  time  to  be  concerned  about  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  situation,  we  need  to  break  this  battlefield  quickly!”</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  discussed  quickly  and  reached  a  consensus.</p>
<p>But  how  could  it  be  easy  to  find  a  person  in  the  ant  nest  battlefield  that  was   as  large  as  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven?</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  tried  many  methods  but  had  no  gains.</p>
<p>Wu  Shuai  was  hiding  at  a  corner,  leisurely  mobilizing  army  ants  to  move   through  countless  tunnels,  to  attack  the  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  who   were  in  a  formation.</p>
<p>The  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  formed  a  battle  formation  to   temporarily  trap  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  but  were  being  attacked  fiercely  from  the   outside.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  saw  the  chance  and  raised  tens  of  thousands  of  qi  currents,   Heavenly  Court’s  four  immortals  received  the  attack  and  were  at  the  brink   of  death.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  were  unable  to  find  Wu  Shuai  for  the   moment  and  focused  their  strength  to  suppress  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>After  several  exchanges,  the  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  were  soaked  in   blood,  their  aura  declined  again,  on  the  contrary,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  still  had   ample  energy  and  strength.</p>
<p>“If  this  formation  were  made  of  the  four  major  paths—earth,  water,  wind,   and  fire—its  strength  should  be  much  higher.  Unfortunately,  you  lack  a   wind  path  expert.”  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  laughed,  as  time  passed,  he  started  to   see  many  more  details.</p>
<p>“Qi  Sea,  take  this!”  Golden  Hooped  Great  Immortal  charged  forward,   sending  hundreds  of  golden  hoops  that  flew  chaotically  in  the  air.</p>
<p>The  golden  hoops  were  set  to  land  on  Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  but  were  blocked  by   the  surrounding  qi  currents.</p>
<p>Duke  Mei  suddenly  appeared,  his  snow-white  eyebrows  grew  in  size  and   pierced  through  the  qi  currents,  binding  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  hands.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  gave  a  shout,  qi  currents  erupted  like  a  vast  tide  that   threatened  to  destroy  everything!</p>
<p>The  qi  currents  struck  Golden  Hooped  Great  Immortal,  Duke  Mei,  and  the   other  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals.</p>
<p>At  the  crucial  moment,  Jun  Shen  Guang,  Zhou  Xiong  Xin,  and  others   stepped  in  to  help  the  six  Heavenly  Court  members.</p>
<p>Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  attacked,  his  giant  hand  slammed  down   on  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  head!</p>
<p>At  the  critical  moment,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  smiled  lightly.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Ancestor  Qi  Retraction!</p>
<p>This  move  was  modified  from  triple  qi  retraction  killer  move,  it  used  two   great  rank  eight  Immortal  Gu,  Heaven  Qi  and  Earth  Qi,  as  the  cores.  All  the</p>
<p>lifeforms  in  the  range  of  the  killer  move  would  gradually  turn  into  qi   currents  that  would  return  to  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  turn  into  qi  path  dao   marks.</p>
<p>Hence,  this  was  not  only  an  offensive  method,  but  could  also  be  used  to   cultivate  and  increase  the  number  of  his  qi  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>This  move  was  extremely  powerful  and  mysterious  but  had  two  huge  flaws.</p>
<p>Firstly,  it  consumed  a  lot  of  lifespan.</p>
<p>Secondly,  once  the  move  was  activated,  whether  it  succeeded  or  failed,  it   could  not  be  activated  again  for  one  hundred  days  (in  terms  of  Qi  Sea   Ancestor’s  time).</p>
<p>Under  ancestor  qi  retraction,  Heavenly  Court’s  Gu  Immortals  were  first   shackled,  unable  to  even  budge.</p>
<p>Duke  Mei  was  the  first  person  affected.  His  eyebrows,  skin,  blood,  flesh,   and  lastly  his  bones,  organs,  and  so  on  were  all  melted  into  qi  currents  that   were  absorbed  by  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>When  Duke  Mei’s  corrosion  reached  his  bones,  Golden  Hooped  Great   Immortal  also  started  turning  into  qi  until  he  was  reduced  to  nothingness.</p>
<p>Duke  Mei  and  Golden  Hooped  Great  Immortal  died  one  after  the  other,   followed  by  Jun  Shen  Guang,  Zhou  Xiong  Xin,  and  others,  before  finally   affecting  the  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  who  were  the  furthest  away.</p>
<p>Wan  Zi  Hong  was  the  first  to  be  unable  to  hold  on,  second  was  Prince  Feng   Xian,  then  Bai  Cang  Shui  and  Uncle  Feng.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  looked  at  the  four:  ”You  still  lack  tacit  coordination.  More   importantly,  two  of  you  have  been  revived  recently  and  don’t  have  all  your   Gu  worms  so  your  conditions  are  not  perfect,  which  is  the  greatest  flaw  in   this  battle  formation.  You  are  dreaming  if  you  want  to  trap  me!”</p>
<p>The  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  held  on  with  clenched  teeth  and  had  no   energy  to  reply.</p>
<p>Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  was  unwilling  to  give  in,  most  of  his   body  had  already  melted  but  he  still  raised  his  injured  fist  and  tried  to   smash  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>“You  all  seem  to  have  forgotten  me.”  Wu  Shuai’s  voice  rang  in  the   battlefield.  Densely  packed  army  ants  climbed  up  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval   Monarch’s  body.</p>
<p>The  giant  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  broke  apart  at  the  very  next   moment.</p>
<p>“Our  main  body  is  arriving,  we’ve  won  this  battle!”  Wu  Shuai  laughed   loudly.</p>
<p>He  could  tell  that  even  without  him  making  a  move,  in  just  a  while  longer,   Qi  Sea  Ancestor  would  be  able  to  kill  the  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals.</p>
<p>“Is  that  so?”  At  the  juncture  of  defeat,  Prince  Feng  Xian  suddenly  revealed   a  smug  smile:  ”Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  you  fell  for  it.”</p>
<p>His  words  had  not  even  finished  when  Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  who  was  in  the   center  of  the  Four  Elements  Shifting  Formation,  shook  suddenly.</p>
<p>The  qi  currents  around  him  transformed  rapidly  into  the  appearance  of  Lin   Jian  Xing,  and  he  stood  right  behind  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing,  who  was  formed  from  the  qi  currents,  was  lifelike,  but  he   had  no  expression.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  he  moved  forward  and  forcefully  entered  Qi  Sea   Ancestor’s  body.</p>
<p>Immediately,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  suffered  a  severe  injury,  his  defenses   crumbled  apart.</p>
<p>In  a  battlefield  not  far  away.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  smiled  inside  Embroidered  Tower  and  disregarded   Zhan  Bu  Du  as  she  threw  out  Star  Constellation  Chessboard:  ”Now,  you   shall  see  the  true  secret  of  the  star  array  calculation  formation!”</p>
<p>The  star  array  calculation  formation  collapsed,  the  remaining  stars  self- detonated  and  let  out  a  majestic  and  strange  power.  Under  the  control  of   Star  Constellation  Chessboard,  this  power  directly  broke  the  ant  nest   battlefield  and  reduced  the  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  into  powder,   finally  sealing  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>“Go!”  The  voice  of  Star  Constellation’s  will  transmitted  from  Star   Constellation  Chessboard.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Chessboard  circled  rapidly  above  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s   head,  shooting  starry  radiance  that  covered  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  dragged   him  towards  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  entrance  opened  a  little,  having  clearly  been  prepared  for   a  long  time  for  this  moment.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  main  body  arrived  and  saw  this  scene,  his  expression   immediately  turned  shocked  and  furious  as  he  shouted:  ”Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable,  so  this  is  all  your  scheme!”</p>
