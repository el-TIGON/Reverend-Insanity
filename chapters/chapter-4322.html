        <p>:  Fang  Yuan’s  Admiration  Towards</p>
<p>Star  Constellation</p>
<p>During  this  period  of  time,  how  many  Gu  Masters  went  through  immortal   ascension  in  sovereign  immortal  aperture?</p>
<p>Golden  Fur  Immortal  Monarch,  Hair  Monster  Grotto  Lord,  Lightning  Lion   Warrior,  Dharma  Lion  Warrior,  Solid  Rock  Warrior,  Steel  Rush  Warrior,   Frost  Butterfly  Warrior,  An  Chong,  Ye  Zhi,  Crossing  Heaven  Immortal   Monarch,  Black  Locust,  Rainbow  Rock  Immortal  Concubine,  Great   Wisdom  Immortal  Mother,  Bing  Yuan,  Bing  Zhuo,  Ice  Crystal  Immortal   Monarch,  Shi  Zong,  Ke  Xin  Hong,  the  six  eggmen  of  Rotten  Egg  grotto- heaven,  Xiao  He  Jian,  Green  Forest  Great  Sage,  and  now,  Gu  Yue  Fang   Xiang!</p>
<p>Most  of  the  Gu  Immortals  who  died  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave  were  already   revived.  This  was  excluding  those  who  died  during  the  chaotic  disaster.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  did  not  revive  them  as  Gu  Immortals,  he  only  gave  them  Gu   Master  cultivation  level.</p>
<p>One  was  to  save  resources  and  prevent  Human  Sea  from  getting  expended,   the  other  reason  was  for  this  opportunity!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  always  had  a  broad  vision,  he  was  also  skilled  at  creating   plans.</p>
<p>But  in  the  past,  his  plans  were  often  unable  to  keep  up  with  changes.</p>
<p>Now,  he  had  rank  nine  cultivation  level,  he  was  a  refinement  path   venerable.  With  the  destruction  of  fate  Gu,  there  were  few  things  in  the   world  that  could  disrupt  his  plans!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  purposely  made  accumulations  in  the  past,  now,  during  this   trend  of  immortal  ascension,  he  benefited  immensely.</p>
<p>In  just  a  few  months,  in  just  sovereign  immortal  aperture  alone,  more  than   thirty  Gu  Masters  went  through  immortal  ascension,  this  was  excluding   Fang  Yuan’s  subordinate  super  forces  in  Eastern  Sea  and  the  two  heavens.</p>
<p>Wu  clan  who  was  extremely  famous  now  could  not  compare  with  such   results.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  concealed  them  all,  not  a  single  bit  of  information  was   leaked.</p>
<p>As  for  the  benefits  of  immortal  ascension,  only  a  very  small  portion  was  for   those  who  became  rank  six  Gu  Immortals,  the  bulk  of  the  gains  went  to   Fang  Yuan  through  stealing  heavenly  secret!</p>
<p>This  was  something  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable  could  not  dream  of  obtaining.</p>
<p>The  truth  was,  even  Fang  Yuan  did  not  think  that  his  gains  would  be  so   huge!!</p>
<p>He  obtained  a  large  number  of  killer  moves,  Gu  recipes,  Immortal  Gu   Houses,  immortal  formations,  blueprints  to  construct  battlefield  killer   moves,  countless  ways  to  cultivate  resources,  as  well  as  the  most</p>
<p>comprehensive  map  of  the  current  five  regions,  and  the  location  of  various   wild  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>After  satisfying  his  needs,  he  looked  into  human  path,  pill  path,  painting   path,  star  path,  luck  path,  and  others.</p>
<p>The  outcome  was  extremely  surprising  to  Fang  Yuan,  he  was  pleasantly   stunned!</p>
<p>He  had  only  given  it  a  test  but  he  obtained  musician  Immortal  Gu’s  recipe,   thief  Immortal  Gu’s  recipe,  soldier  Immortal  Gu’s  recipe,  sergeant  Immortal   Gu’s  recipe,  and  others,  he  even  obtained  a  vast  number  of  pill  path  and   painting  path  Immortal  Gu  recipes.</p>
<p>He  also  gained  various  profundities  of  luck  path,  star  path,  and  soul  path   that  were  very  useful  to  him.</p>
<p>Now  that  Fang  Yuan  recalled  it,  the  human  path  gains  shocked  him  the   most:  ”To  think  that  human  path  has  already  developed  to  this  extent  in  the   current  world.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  know  of  the  existence  of  the  derivation  formation,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  hidden  it  too  well.</p>
<p>However,  the  root  issue  was  with  the  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>The  core  of  the  derivation  formation  was  rank  nine  derivation  Gu,  it  was   not  refined  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  so  it  was  still  a  wild   Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>It  was  not  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  want  to  refine   it,  but  it  could  only  be  used  in  this  situation  as  a  wild  Gu.</p>
<p>Once  derivation  Gu  was  refined  by  a  person,  it  would  become  useless.</p>
<p>Limitless  Demon  Venerable  had  given  it  a  try,  thus,  the  Crazed  Demon   formation  still  used  a  wild  rank  nine  derivation  Gu  as  the  core.</p>
<p>However,  the  innermost  layers  of  Crazed  Demon  Cave  were  isolated  from   the  main  world,  thus,  it  did  not  matter  if  derivation  Gu  was  wild  or  not.</p>
<p>This  was  not  the  case  for  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  devoured  too  many  nine  heavens  fragments,  it  was  full   of  heaven’s  will  and  was  the  largest  heaven  vein  node  in  the  two  heavens.</p>
<p>When  the  two  heavens  were  fusing,  Heavenly  Court  had  to  mobilize  all   their  rank  eight  experts  and  Immortal  Gu  Houses  to  survive  the  ordeal.  In   the  end,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  personally  took  action  after   refining  all  of  Heavenly  Court’s  wisdom  path  dao  marks.  She  stabilized  the   situation  and  prevented  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  from  finding  them.</p>
<p>The  current  derivation  formation  was  situated  inside  Heavenly  Court,  it  was   observable  by  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  could  not  stop  that  as  long  as  it  was   inside  Heavenly  Court</p>
<p>Heaven’s  will  was  one  of  the  foundations  of  Heavenly  Court  itself.</p>
<p>Other  than  Heavenly  Court,  where  else  could  she  safely  put  the  derivation   formation?</p>
<p>Nowhere.</p>
<p>At  least,  nowhere  in  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Thus,  everything  within  the  derivation  formation  was  also  known  by  heaven   and  earth.</p>
<p>This  was  a  major  flaw  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  knew.</p>
<p>But  it  did  not  matter.</p>
<p>Or  rather,  in  her  perspective,  it  did  not  matter.</p>
<p>The  reason?</p>
<p>Heaven’s  will  did  not  like  any  of  the  venerables  now.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   had  revived,  how  could  heaven’s  will  allow  people  to  revive?</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  even  worse,  he  was  a  complete  otherworldly  demon,  one  of   the  main  culprits  who  destroyed  fate  Gu.</p>
<p>Only  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  more  favored  by  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>But  he  had  lost  his  senses,  even  if  he  wanted  to  target  Heavenly  Court,  with   the  door  shut  tight,  he  could  not  find  his  way  in!</p>
<p>Even  if  he  entered,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  the   amplification  of  Heavenly  Court’s  wisdom  path  dao  marks,  would  she  fear   him?  It  would  be  the  best  chance  to  kill  him!</p>
<p>Like  how  Fang  Yuan  did  not  know  of  the  derivation  formation,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  also  did  not  know  that  Fang  Yuan  had   rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu.</p>
<p>And  most  importantly,  Fang  Yuan  created  stealing  heavenly  secret  killer   move!</p>
<p>Regardless  of  the  inclination  of  heaven’s  will,  Fang  Yuan  could  use  natural   inspiration  to  steal  countless  heavenly  secrets.</p>
<p>The  three  qi  surrounded  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  who  was  currently  undergoing   natural  inspiration.</p>
<p>Seeing  this,  Fang  Yuan  restrained  his  scattered  thoughts  and  focused:  ”What   heavenly  secret  should  I  steal  this  time?”</p>
<p>He  thought  about  it:  ”I  can  ask  for  Heavenly  Court’s  information  directly,   that  seems  fine.  No  matter  how  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  tries   to  hide  things,  my  stealing  heavenly  secret  is  rank  nine.  If  she  wants  to</p>
<p>resist  it,  she  needs  to  have  a  rank  nine  wisdom  path  Immortal  Gu  to  achieve   a  qualitative  change!</p>
<p>No  matter  how  many  wisdom  path  dao  marks  Heavenly  Court  had,  it  was   only  a  quantitative  amplification.</p>
<p>When  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang’s  aperture  exploded  to  create  an  immortal   aperture,  becoming  a  rank  six  Gu  Immortal,  Fang  Yuan’s  body  shook.</p>
<p>“Derivation  immortal  formation?!”</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  hid  it  too  deeply,  I  only  found  out   now.”</p>
<p>“So  that’s  it.”</p>
<p>“Incredible,  as  expected  of  the  number  one  wisdom  path  expert  throughout   the  past  and  present!”</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  Fang  Yuan  felt  deep  admiration  towards  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>She  actually  had  such  a  method  to  rapidly  promote  the  development  of   various  paths.</p>
<p>The  might  of  wisdom  path  was  truly  terrifying.</p>
<p>Such  an  enemy  was  worth  admiring!</p>
<p>Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  stopped  his  action  of  refining  Northern   Plains’  luck  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>“It  is  about  time.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  inspected  the  surroundings  first.  He  had  a   unique  way  of  refining  Northern  Plains’  luck  path  dao  marks,  he  did  not   stay  at  the  same  place  for  long,  moving  to  other  places  after  fully  refining   all  of  the  dao  marks  in  one  area.</p>
<p>Instead,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  refined  dao  marks  broadly,  after   refining  sixty  percent  of  the  luck  path  dao  marks  of  a  certain  area  in   Northern  Plains,  he  would  move  on  to  the  next  location  and  continue  his   refinement.</p>
<p>After  the  battle  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   started  to  refine  Northern  Plains’  dao  marks.</p>
<p>After  various  events  like  the  Great  Love  declaration,  Fang  clan’s  saga,   Spectral  Soul  destroying  the  sun,  the  three  venerables’  contest  over  light   Gu,  and  the  trend  of  immortal  ascension,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   finally  refined  sixty  percent  of  Northern  Plains’  luck  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>He  had  already  covered  the  entire  Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  he  did  not  forget  to  develop  his  own  rank  nine  immortal   aperture,  he  went  through  several  tribulations  and  put  in  several  resource   points.</p>
<p>With  the  increased  foundation  of  his  rank  nine  immortal  aperture,  his   immortal  essence  production  speed  also  rose.</p>
<p>As  time  passed,  the  immortal  aperture  foundation  of  the  venerables  would   rise  rapidly,  their  immortal  essence  would  become  more  abundant.</p>
<p>BUt  now,  Giant  Sun’s  immortal  aperture  was  still  far  inferior  to  Longevity   Heaven.</p>
<p>Longevity  Heaven  was  the  rank  nine  immortal  aperture  that  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  had  in  his  previous  life.  Because  it  did  not  devour  any   nine  heavens  fragment,  it  had  gone  through  many  calamities  and   tribulations  over  the  years,  gaining  a  huge  number  of  dao  marks  through   them.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  have  sovereign  immortal  aperture,  he   could  not  annex  a  larger  immortal  aperture,  while  he  also  had  to  cultivate   blood  path.  Thus,  if  he  wanted  to  annex  Longevity  Heaven  and  gain  the   maximum  benefit,  he  still  lacked  a  lot  of  accumulation.</p>
<p>In  terms  of  foundation,  Longevity  Heaven  was  inferior  to  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  the  immortal  aperture  of  three  venerables,  while  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable  only  had  his  own  rank  nine  aperture  as  the   foundation  of  his  previous  life.</p>
<p>But  Longevity  Heaven  had  a  huge  advantage  that  Heavenly  Court  lacked.</p>
<p>In  the  future,  after  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  blood  path  cultivation   reach  a  certain  level,  he  could  annex  Longevity  Heaven  to  raise  his  strength   to  a  terrifying  level!</p>
<p>After  some  rest,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  started  to  prepare  his  killer   move.</p>
<p>As  the  killer  move  activated,  soon,  with  the  amplification  of  sixty  percent   of  Northern  Plains’  luck  path  dao  marks,  a  golden  light  appeared  in  the  sky,   dying  the  sky  of  the  entire  Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>“Good,  with  this  luck  path  killer  move,  in  the  future  when  my  bloodline   descendants  undergo  tribulation,  they  will  receive  some  help!”</p>
<p>This  was  not  just  for  immortal  ascension,  in  the  future,  when  Gu  Immortals   undergo  calamities  and  tribulations,  this  luck  path  killer  move  would  take   effect  and  turn  the  tribulation  into  one  that  the  Gu  Immortal  could  easily   deal  with,  at  the  same  time,  the  power  of  the  tribulation  would  also  be   adjusted  accordingly.</p>
<p>If  the  Gu  Immortal  undergoing  tribulation  was  strong,  the  luck  path  killer   move  would  make  the  calamities  and  tribulations  stronger,  so  that  they   could  get  more  dao  marks  after  succeeding.</p>
<p>Conversely,  weakening  the  calamities  and  tribulations  would  allow  the  Gu   Immortals  to  survive  and  pass  the  tribulation.</p>
<p>This  luck  path  killer  move  was  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  newest   creation,  it  contained  the  profundity  of  heaven  and  earth  luck  and  all  living   being’s  luck,  in  the  future,  it  could  even  fuse  with  self  luck  to  form  a   mystical  power.</p>
<p>After  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  refined  most  of  Northern  Plains’  luck   path  dao  marks,  the  Huang  Jin  tribes  of  the  entire  region  benefited  as  a   result.</p>
<p>The  mystic  power  of  luck  path  was  starting  to  display  itself  on  a  wide  scale.</p>
<p>In  the  future,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  planned  to  use  other  luck  path   killer  moves  to  support  the  entire  Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>He  would  let  himself,  Longevity  Heaven,  and  the  various  Huang  Jin  tribes   to  have  positive  variables  in  anything  they  did,  not  just  tribulations,  they   would  have  good  luck.</p>
<p>If  the  Gu  cultivator  was  strong,  they  would  have  a  tough  time  at  first  and  be   suppressed,  eventually,  they  would  experience  a  rebound  and  gain  immense   benefits.</p>
<p>“However,  these  luck  path  killer  moves  need  to  be  modified  and  carefully   chosen.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  pondered  deeply.</p>
<p>He  could  not  use  too  many  of  such  killer  moves.</p>
<p>Killer  moves  would  carve  dao  marks  upon  use.</p>
<p>If  he  used  them  too  much,  the  entire  Northern  Plains  would  turn  into  a  luck   path  environment.</p>
<p>This  had  its  flaws.</p>
<p>Because  of  conflicting  dao  marks,  all  other  paths  would  be  greatly   suppressed.  This  was  not  beneficial  to  the  growth  of  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Thus,  this  step  was  very  important  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   needed  to  find  a  balance.</p>
<p>“There  is  no  rush  in  doing  this,  I  need  to  consider  the  benefits  and  costs   more  deeply.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  thought  as  he  used  his   investigative  killer  move  again.</p>
<p>This  time,  he  was  not  inspecting  the  venerables  but  the  region  of  Northern   Plains  instead.</p>
<p>Soon,  a  vague  luck  distribution  map  appeared  in  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable’s  mind.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  frowned  slightly.</p>
<p>In  his  first  life,  there  was  great  effect  when  he  used  this  killer  move.  Now,   the  effect  was  more  vague,  especially  towards  the  borders.</p>
<p>“Back  then,  the  five  regions  were  separated  and  independent,  they  were  not   tightly  connected.  Thus,  it  was  easier  to  inspect  the  luck  of  one  region.”</p>
<p>“But  now,  the  five  regions  are  united  while  the  two  heavens  turned  into   spectral  heaven.  To  achieve  the  same  level  of  investigative  power  as  my   previous  life,  I  will  need  to  refine  all  of  the  luck  path  dao  marks  in  the  five   regions.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  reached  a  conclusion  and  stopped  using  his   killer  move.</p>
<p>He  had  just  used  two  immortal  killer  moves  in  succession,  they  used  a  lot  of   immortal  killer  move.  His  immortal  killer  move  storage  had  reached  an   alarming  level  once  again.</p>
<p>Next,  he  would  need  to  rest  for  some  time  before  refining  Northern  Plains’   dao  marks  again.  Otherwise,  he  would  be  in  danger  if  the  venerables  decide   to  fight.</p>
