    <h1>Chapter  2323</h1>
    <p>:  Central  Continent  Held  Hostage</p>
<p>“Success!  We  succeeded!!”  Prince  Feng  Xian  shouted  loudly,  his  pale  face   was  filled  with  excitement.</p>
<p>“I  accomplished  the  mission…”  Wan  Zi  Hong’s  eyes  were  shut,  her  aura   was  almost  depleted,  she  had  never  felt  so  weak  and  tired  before.</p>
<p>The  so-called  Four  Elements  Shifting  Formation  was  only  a  cover  to  lure   attention  away,  its  true  goal  was  to  create  an  environment  for  Lin  Jian   Xing’s  sword  qi  takes  form  killer  move!</p>
<p>Prince  Feng  Xian,  Wan  Zi  Hong,  and  the  rest  had  lost  in  the  battle  against   Lin  Jian  Xing  not  long  ago.</p>
<p>When  they  returned,  they  admitted  their  blunder  to  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  with  a  heavy  heart  but  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  instead  rewarded  them  and  said:  This  was  all  part  of  her  plan!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  the  number  one  person  in   wisdom  path  since  ancient  times.  In  the  contest  of  three  venerables,  she  had   relied  on  all  kinds  of  small  clues  to  deduce  that  Lin  Jian  Xing  was  an   otherworldly  demon  and  that  his  strength  had  reached  pseudo  venerable   level.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  was  cultivating  in  seclusion,  hiding  his  strength.  The  world   did  not  know  of  his  secret.</p>
<p>Although  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  deduced  it,  she  kept  it  a   secret.</p>
<p>Then  she  intentionally  sent  the  five  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  to  attack   Lin  Jian  Xing.  The  goal  was  to  use  phantom  path  methods  to  capture  the   power  of  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  killer  move.</p>
<p>Everyone  knew  that  the  Heavenly  Court  members’  immortal  apertures  were   phantom  apertures.</p>
<p>The  injuries  that  they  suffered  in  the  intense  battle  with  Lin  Jian  Xing  were   essentially  sword  path  dao  marks  being  engraved  on  them.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  deduced  and  modified  a  phantom   path  method  to  make  these  phantom  apertures  contain  those  sword  path  dao   marks  and  bring  them  back  along  with  the  Heavenly  Court  members.</p>
<p>The  retrieved  sword  path  dao  marks  could  restore  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  method   after  a  series  of  procedures.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  struck  by  this  move,  he  immediately  lost  his  footing   and  was  then  attacked  by  Star  Constellation’s  will,  he  did  not  even  have  the   time  to  defend  when  he  was  sealed.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  concealed  the  truth  and  only  told  the   Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  of  her  plan  after  they  returned.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  even  apologized  to  the  immortals.</p>
<p>The  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  did  not  dare  to  accept  the  apology  and   only  felt  intense  joy  with  not  even  any  grievance.</p>
<p>They  were  loyal  to  Heavenly  Court  and  realized  that  it  was  very  reasonable   of  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  conceal  the  truth.  Only  under   the  condition  where  they  did  not  know  of  it  could  they  maintain  such  a   secret  and  fight  with  Lin  Jian  Xing  without  revealing  any  flaws  in  their   emotions.</p>
<p>“But  why  try  so  hard  to  capture  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  method?”  Wan  Zi  Hong  had   mentioned  this  doubt  back  then.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  reply,  only  instructing  them   to  follow  her  arrangements.</p>
<p>When  they  saw  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  being  sealed,  Prince  Feng  Xian  and  Wan   Zi  Hong  finally  understood  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  effort.</p>
<p>The  most  important  element  was  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  power.</p>
<p>First  of  all,  he  was  a  pseudo  venerable  himself,  although  he  was  weaker   than  Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  Heavenly  Court’s  replicated  sword  qi  method  had   gone  through  many  amplifications  and  was  stronger  than  Lin  Jian  Xing’s   current  limit.</p>
<p>Secondly,  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  core  Immortal  Gu  was  sword  qi  Gu,  although  his   sword  qi  was  filled  with  sword  path  dao  marks,  it  also  had  dense  number  of   qi  path  dao  marks.  It  was  because  of  this  that  it  could  target  Qi  Sea   Ancestor  who  cultivated  qi  path.</p>
<p>Finally,  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  sword  qi  attack  was  too  sudden,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor   was  truly  caught  off  guard.</p>
<p>“Qi  Sea  Ancestor  is  finally  sealed.  But  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  spent  so  much  effort  and  trouble  to  capture  Qi  Sea  Ancestor,   what  is  this  for?”</p>
<p>“Qi  Sea  Ancestor  is  the  strongest  clone  of  Heaven  Refining  Demon   Venerable,  maybe  it  is  to  restrain  Fang  Yuan?”</p>
<p>“I  heard  Fairy  Maiden  Soul  modified  Bo  Qing’s  soul,  this  shows  that  clones   might  be  convenient  but  are  also  a  huge  flaw  of  the  main  body.”</p>
<p>The  other  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  discussed  as  they  watched  Qi  Sea   Ancestor  being  escorted  to  Heavenly  Court’s  entrance.</p>
<p>“Stop  dreaming!”  Right  at  this  time,  a  venerable  landed  from  the  sky.</p>
<p>He  was  wearing  a  white  robe,  his  black  hair  fluttered  in  the  air,  his  eyes   were  black  like  the  abyss,  and  his  face  showed  fury  and  killing  intent.</p>
<p>It  was  Fang  Yuan!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  grabbed  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  shoulder  as  he  maintained  reverse   flow  protection  seal  and  activated  another  move.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Arrival  of  Dragon  Snake  with  Dust  Fog  and   Explosive  Soul  Wind!</p>
<p>Fog  billowed,  dragons  and  snakes  roared,  forming  a  terrifying  attack  that   fell  on  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  like  a  vast  heavenly  river.</p>
<p>Seeing  Fang  Yuan  trying  to  kill  his  strongest  clone  without  any   consideration,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  who  was  close  behind   showed  a  solemn  expression.</p>
<p>“Friend  Fang  Yuan,  you  are  indeed  vicious!  You  show  no  hesitation  even   when  getting  rid  of  your  own  clone.  Unfortunately  for  you,  I  am  here.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  took  back  her  secluded  domain  of   heaven  and  earth  Mental  Domain  and  stretched  her  ten  fingers.  Her  fingers   pointed  repeatedly  with  such  speed  that  it  created  multicolored  shadows  of   her  moving  fingers.</p>
<p>The  finger  shadows  condensed  into  deep-blue  lights  that  were  extremely   bright  like  shining  crystals.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  soul  fog  was  constantly  cut  by  the  blue  crystal  light  and   crumbled  rapidly,  the  remaining  power  was  blocked  by  Embroidered  Tower   while  some  traces  of  the  power  reached  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  but  were  blocked   by  the  tight  defenses  of  Star  Constellation  Chessboard.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation,  you!”  Fang  Yuan’s  eyes  narrowed  sharply  as  he  looked   at  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>In  the  previous  fight,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  not  used   such  a  method.  It  was  not  that  she  did  not  have  them  but  chose  to  not  use   them.</p>
<p>She  had  been  concealing  them!</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  being  sealed  and  Fang  Yuan  counterattacking  fiercely  were   within  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  expectations.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  defended  with  all  her  strength,  not   letting  Fang  Yuan  have  any  progress.</p>
<p>If  it  were  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  who  attacked  Qi  Sea   Ancestor  and  tried  to  capture  him,  she  would  be  obstructed  by  Fang  Yuan   and  could  not  succeed  easily.  With  the  same  logic,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was   already  captured  now,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  the   initiative  and  it  became  easier  for  her  to  obstruct  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>In  the  end,  under  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  obstruction  and   protection,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  escorted  into  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>“Master’s  revival…  there  is  finally  some  hope.”  A  huge  rock  weighing  on   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  mind  was  lifted  at  this  sight,  she   could  not  restrain  her  joy.</p>
<p>In  the  contest  of  three  venerables,  with  Spectral  Soul  controlling  the  fused   heaven,  Giant  Sun  and  Fang  Yuan  only  had  one  option  which  was  to   confront  each  other  and  wait  for  a  chance  while  managing  and  preparing   their  forces.</p>
<p>But  there  was  a  better  option  for  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>That  was  to  revive  other  venerables.</p>
<p>Three  Immortal  Kings  appeared  in  Heavenly  Court’s  history,  if  Red  Lotus   Demon  Venerable  was  also  counted,  it  could  be  said  that  they  nurtured  four   venerables.</p>
<p>Among  eleven  venerables,  four  were  from  Heavenly  Court,  this  was  a  huge   number.</p>
<p>Besides  this,  there  were  no  other  super  forces  that  could  nurture  a   venerable.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  was  the  first  and  the  only  super  force.</p>
<p>As  long  as  another  venerable  was  revived,  Heavenly  Court  would  have  a   huge  advantage.</p>
<p>There  was  no  need  to  consider  Red  Lotus  for  now  but  Primordial  Origin   and  Genesis  Lotus  were  very  good  candidates  to  revive.</p>
<p>From  what  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  knew,  Primordial  Origin   and  Genesis  Lotus  had  two  revival  methods  but  they  were  concealed   deeply.</p>
<p>Time  was  needed  to  search  for  clues  regarding  Genesis  Lotus’s  self-portrait   and  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  Primordial  Origin  Treasury,  it   clearly  seemed  like  it  would  take  a  long  time.  But  Primordial  Origin   Immortal  Venerable  had  another  revival  method,  it  was  the  qi  harvest  fruit.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  qi  harvest  fruit  formed  Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  so  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  trap  Qi  Sea  and  resume  the   interrupted  revival  of  Primordial  Origin.</p>
<p>To  do  this,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  could  not  be  killed.  He  needed  to  be  alive  to   preserve  the  qi  harvest  fruit  as  much  as  possible.</p>
<p>The  difficulty  in  capturing  a  pseudo  venerable  alive  was  very  high!</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  could  even  endure  one  or  two  moves  from  a  venerable  and   was  not  without  any  ability  to  resist.  This  was  because  he  had  the  secluded   domain  of  heaven  and  earth  Hu  Land,  while  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  lacked  a  rank  nine  wisdom  path  or  star  path  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Moreover,  Fang  Yuan  had  plenty  of  experience  and  was  very  crafty.   Normally,  he  paid  a  lot  of  attention  to  his  clones’  safety  and  stored  them  in</p>
<p>his  immortal  aperture,  very  rarely  sending  them  out.</p>
<p>If  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  were  to  make  a  move  personally,   the  commotion  would  be  too  huge  and  she  would  be  obstructed  by  Fang   Yuan  at  the  very  beginning.</p>
<p>Thus,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  began  to  plan.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  lacked  pseudo  venerable  level  battle  strength,  it  was  an   obvious  disadvantage  but  it  could  be  turned  into  an  advantage  if  used  well.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  set  up  the  star  array  calculation   formation  to  quicken  the  cultivation  speed  of  Central  Continent’s  Gu   Immortals  and  also  to  use  as  bait  to  lure  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  then  used  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  strength  as   the  crucial  method  to  target  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.  At  the  same  time,  she  also   showed  all  kinds  of  flaws  to  display  her  weakness  to  the  enemy.</p>
<p>She  still  thought  all  these  preparations  were  not  enough.</p>
<p>Heaven  path  dream  realms!</p>
<p>This  was  an  opportunity  to  Fang  Yuan,  but  was  it  not  a  fortuitous  encounter   for  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable?</p>
<p>As  long  as  the  enemy’s  fortuitous  encounter  was  used  properly,  it  might  be   one’s  own  fortuitous  encounter!</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan  will  definitely  come!”  The  moment  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  discovered  the  heaven  path  dream  realms,  she  knew   what  Fang  Yuan’s  action  would  be.</p>
<p>She  could  not  do  anything  to  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  and  Feng  Jin   Huang  had  not  grown  up,  but  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  could   use  them  as  bait!</p>
<p>In  fact,  even  if  Feng  Jin  Huang  was  fully  matured,  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  was  somewhat  doubtful  about  using  this  girl.</p>
<p>Feng  Jin  Huang’s  father  was  Feng  Jiu  Ge,  the  latter  had  an  unclear   relationship  with  Red  Lotus  Demon  Venerable.  Dream  wings  Immortal  Gu   took  the  initiative  to  send  itself  to  Feng  Jin  Huang,  it  was  clearly  the  fortune   of  being  Great  Dream’s  seed,  and  the  so-called  Great  Dream  Immortal   Venerable  was  the  plan  of  heaven’s  will  when  fate  Gu  still  existed.</p>
<p>Could  such  a  person  be  used?  Especially  at  such  a  crucial  time?</p>
<p>The  only  miscalculation  was  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did   not  expect  Fang  Yuan  to  move  so  quickly.</p>
<p>“Since  he  moved  this  fast,  he  definitely  has  the  strength  to  back  himself   up.”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  already  expected  this  at  the  start   of  the  battle.</p>
<p>So  when  Fang  Yuan  continued  to  reveal  his  strength  in  the  battle,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  not  as  surprised  as  what  she  showed   on  the  surface.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan  modified  so  many  methods  and  has  new  killer  moves,  he  has   very  likely  obtained  wisdom  Gu  again.”  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  stood  before  the  entrance  of  the  Heavenly  Court  and  faced  Fang   Yuan.</p>
<p>Starlight  shone  dazzlingly  on  this  number  one  person  in  wisdom  path,  she   said  with  a  smile:  ”Friend  Fang  Yuan,  do  you  dare  to  come  into  Heavenly   Court?”</p>
<p>Saying  so,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  slowly  floated  backwards   and  entered  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  entrance  was  still  open.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  stood  on  the  spot!</p>
<p>He  snorted  coldly  as  he  activated  killer  moves  one  after  the  other.  First  was   Arrival  of  Dragon  Snake  with  Dust  Fog  and  Explosive  Soul  Wind,  then  was   Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound,  but  both   were  easily  blocked  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  strength  surged  with  the  help  of   Heavenly  Court’s  countless  wisdom  path  dao  marks!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  face  was  extremely  dark  as  he  sneered:  ”You  are  really  the   number  one  person  in  wisdom  path,  it  is  truly  amazing.  How  about  we   undergo  a  hostage  exchange?”</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan,  you  don’t  have  anything  now,  what  can  you  exchange  with?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  spread  his  arms  and  said  loudly:  ”Right  now,  every  single  person   in  Central  Continent—be  it  man  or  woman,  old  or  young,  immortal  or   mortal,  intelligent  or  stupid—is  my  hostage!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sighed.</p>
<p>She  had  already  predicted  this,  her  expression  was  a  complex  mix  of   helplessness,  guilt,  resolve,  resentment,  and  others.</p>
<p>In  the  end,  her  expression  turned  cold  as  she  said  to  Fang  Yuan:  ”Do  what   you  want.”</p>
