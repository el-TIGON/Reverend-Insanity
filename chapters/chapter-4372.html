        <p>:  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  Explanation</p>
<p>Spectral  heaven  battlefield.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Seven  kills  rainbow  attacked,  while  starlight  shone  around  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  as  she  dodged.</p>
<p>She  was  about  to  counterattack,  when  she  saw  Fang  Yuan  hiding  beside   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.  Since  the  battle  started,  this  situation  had   already  occurred  about  a  hundred  times.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  no  longer  as  peeved  as  she  was   at  first.  She  looked  at  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  being  attacked  by   hundreds  of  Spectral  Soul’s  giant  hands  and  activated  a  killer  move,   destroying  tens  of  black  hands  rapidly.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  used  the  chance  to  get  past  the  encirclement   of  the  giant  hands.  Being  suddenly  attacked,  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  changed  his  target  to  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation,  lure  the  attention  of  Spectral  Soul  while  I  go  and   capture  Fang  Yuan!”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  said  quickly  when  he   saw  this.  He  then  turned  into  golden  light  that  moved  rapidly  past  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  towards  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>However,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly,  she  did  not   stay  to  stall  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  leaving  a  star  avatar  while  her</p>
<p>true  body  retreated.</p>
<p>The  star  avatar  was  instantly  destroyed  by  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,   he  then  turned  around  and  attacked  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  entrapped  once  again  and  quickly   transmitted  his  voice  to  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  with  some   doubts:  ”Star  Constellation,  what  are  you  doing?”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  directly  gave  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  the  details  of  what  happened  in  the  star  array  calculation   formation,  she  questioned:  ”Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  how  do  you   explain  this?”</p>
<p>“This…”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  laughed  awkwardly  as  he  realized   what  happened,  ”Have  you  heard  of  the  luck  path  theory,  that  luck  turns   better  after  hitting  rock-bottom  and  that  fortune  and  misfortune  coexist?   This  luck  path  killer  move  works  like  that.  After  it  is  activated,  I  lose  all   control  over  it.  I  have  no  idea  how  it  will  work  and  what  effect  it  will   show.”</p>
<p>“The  star  array  calculation  formation  is  not  destroyed,  this  is  only  a  small   mishap.  Good  luck  comes  after  bad  luck,  this  mishap  will  create  a  huge   fortune  in  the  near  future!  We  should  be  expectant.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sneered:  ”Using  my  mishap  to   exchange  for  your  fortune?  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  is  this  what  you   are  saying?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  choked  on  his  words  and  could  only  say:  ”I   will  compensate  you  for  all  the  direct  losses,  but  how  about  we  discuss  the   specific  amount  after  the  fight?”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  nodded  at  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  and  continued  to  fight  alongside  him.</p>
<p>She  chose  to  believe  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>In  her  opinion,  although  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  standpoint  was   different  from  Heavenly  Court,  he  placed  great  importance  on  family  and   had  clear  morals,  he  cherished  his  descendants  and  was  very  protective  of   them.</p>
<p>There  was  a  clear  difference  between  him  and  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  no  limits  and  needed  to  be  guarded  against,  his  promises   could  not  be  trusted.  But  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  words  were   believable  to  a  degree.</p>
<p>Especially  when  this  compensation  was  not  the  important  thing.</p>
<p>Naturally,  the  important  thing  was  that  in  this  situation,  a  single  venerable   would  not  be  able  to  deal  with  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   could  not  stand  by  and  watch  Fang  Yuan  absorb  all  the  heaven  path  dream   realms.</p>
<p>At  the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  stirred  up  countless  qi  currents  that  were  hard  to  block.   Zhan  Bu  Du  charged  forward  like  a  dragon  and  no  one  was  able  to  stop   him.  Wu  Shuai  controlled  countless  ants  to  infiltrate  and  tear  the  whole  star   array  calculation  formation  apart.</p>
<p>Inside  Embroidered  Tower,  Star  Constellation’s  will  did  everything  to  repair   Star  Constellation  Chessboard,  while  controlling  Embroidered  Tower  to   help  the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>The  star  array  calculation  formation  had  very  low  offensive  and  defensive   capabilities,  if  not  for  this,  Giant  Sun  and  Fang  Yuan  would  not  have  stayed   still  as  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  constructed  such  a  formation.</p>
<p>Despite  the  help  of  Embroidered  Tower  and  having  the  Gu  Immortals  inside   the  formation  space  do  their  best  to  control  and  repair  it,  the  star  array</p>
<p>calculation  formation  was  still  crumbling  under  the  fierce  attacks  of  Fang   Yuan’s  three  clones.</p>
<p>Finally,  several  formation  cores  were  exposed.</p>
<p>“These  formation  cores  have  Immortal  Gu.  They  are  quite  mysterious,  my   ants  cannot  infiltrate  them.”  Wu  Shuai  transmitted  his  voice.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  Zhan  Bu  Du  each  made  an  attempt  but  failed  as  well.</p>
<p>These  formation  cores  were  covered  in  starlight  and  it  was  hard  to  tell  if   they  were  real  or  fake.  The  attacks  of  Fang  Yuan’s  clones  had  no  effect  and   only  shook  the  starlight  intensely.</p>
<p>“This  probably  is  a  phantom  path  method.  I  can’t  do  anything.”  Zhan  Bu   Du  shrugged.</p>
<p>He  mainly  relied  on  incomplete  freedom  transformation,  so  he  was  strong   in  charging  and  breaking  enemy  formations,  but  was  not  good  at  other   aspects.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  frowned.  At  this  difficult  time,  he  glanced  at  the  amber   jade  sphere.</p>
<p>After  this  amber  jade  sphere  damaged  Star  Constellation  Chessboard,  its   aura  and  radiance  had  dimmed  by  a  lot,  its  size  shrank  by  sixty  percent,   leaving  only  twenty  percent  of  its  initial  size.</p>
<p>“How  about  we  make  use  of  this  yellow  egg  killer  move  from  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable?”  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  had  already  obtained  the   information  from  the  main  body.</p>
<p>He  communicated  with  the  other  two  clones  and  arranged  a  battle  tactic.</p>
<p>Zhan  Bu  Du  and  Wu  Shuai  lured  the  attention  of  Star  Constellation’s  will,   while  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  used  his  qi  path  giant  hand  to  grab  the  amber  jade   sphere  and  throw  it  towards  the  nearest  formation  core.</p>
<p>Black  Heaven  Temple’s  Gu  Immortal  Zhang  Ji  was  in  charge  of  this   formation  core.  He  saw  the  amber  jade  sphere  approaching  the  formation   core  and  quickly  called  for  help.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  noticed  this  and  immediately  made  a  move.   Embroidered  Tower  shot  out  countless  dao  marks  at  the  amber  jade  sphere,   deviating  its  path  away  from  the  formation  core,  causing  it  to  stop  nearby.</p>
<p>The  Gu  worms  near  the  formation  core  were  affected  by  the  amber  jade   sphere  and  turned  chaotic.</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji  was  just  about  to  suppress  this  emerging  problem  when  Fang   Yuan’s  three  clones  started  attacking  wantonly.</p>
<p>Embroidered  Tower  tried  to  defend  with  all  its  strength  but  the  turbulence   still  affected  other  Gu  worms.  Originally,  whether  these  mortal  Gu  died  or   destabilized  would  not  have  been  an  issue.</p>
<p>As  long  as  the  Immortal  Gu  in  the  formation  core  was  safe,  it  was  okay  to   just  replace  the  mortal  Gu  that  were  lost.</p>
<p>But  the  actual  situation  was  different.</p>
<p>The  destabilization  and  destruction  of  the  surrounding  mortal  Gu  formed   minor  variables  that  accumulated  rapidly,  until  they  threatened  the  Immortal   Gu  in  the  formation  core.</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji’s  effort  to  stabilize  the  situation  instead  assisted  in  this.</p>
<p>Then,  under  his  incredulous  gaze,  the  Immortal  Gu  in  the  formation  core   shattered  directly.</p>
<p>The  Immortal  Gu  in  the  formation  cores  of  the  star  array  calculation   formation  were  originally  intact,  covering  up  for  each  other  and  closely   connected.  Now  that  one  formation  core  suddenly  crumbled  apart,  it   immediately  revealed  a  huge  flaw  in  the  entire  formation.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones  attacked  fiercely,  Star  Constellation’s  will  could   not  consider  anything  else  and  had  to  concentrate  fully  on  protecting  the</p>
<p>star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  how  do  you  explain  this  now?!”  In  spectral   heaven,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  questioned  again.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  sighed:  ”I  will  compensate  you!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly:  ”Is  this  just  an  issue   of  compensation?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  sighed  again:  ”Please  calm  down,  the  most   important  thing  now  is  to  stop  Fang  Yuan.  Do  I  look  like  someone  who   can’t  understand  the  situation?  Once  this  move  is  activated,  it  really  is  out   of  my  control.  We  can  only  watch  as  it  plays  out.”</p>
<p>“Your  move  helped  Fang  Yuan’s  clones  and  is  already  expended,  it  has   disappeared  completely.  How  can  it  trouble  Fang  Yuan’s  clones  now?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  laughed  heartily:  ”It  only  disappeared  on  the   surface,  the  real  variables  are  invisible,  and  have  already  started  to  affect   and  change  the  world  and  all  living  beings.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  mind  shook  slightly,  she  was   deducing  and  deepening  her  understanding  of  the  killer  move  nothing  is   certain  except  success.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  shocking  talent,  this  move  went  beyond   common  sense  and  was  not  in  the  category  of  any  offensive  killer  move  in   history,  it  was  new  and  unique.</p>
<p>“Then  I  shall  wait  and  see.”  With  the  enemy  in  front,  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  could  only  compromise.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  let  out  a  sigh  of  relief  in  actuality.</p>
<p>He  finally  could  relax  now  that  the  amber  jade  sphere  had  disappeared:   ”Even  if  Heavenly  Court  suffers  losses  from  this  move  in  the  future,  there   won’t  be  any  evidence.”</p>
<p>“This  move  triggers  variables  in  a  way  that  is  most  beneficial  to  me.  Looks   like  Heavenly  Court  is  my  main  enemy  currently  which  is  why  this  move   did  not  affect  Fang  Yuan,  instead  helping  him  to  deal  with  Heavenly   Court!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  tried  to  figure  out  the  situation.</p>
<p>In  the  space  inside  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  Gu  Immortal  Zhang   Ji  coughed  out  a  mouthful  of  blood,  his  face  was  extremely  pale.</p>
<p>He  used  all  his  strength  to  protect  the  formation  core  but  still  failed  in  the   end.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones  had  already  latched  onto  the  weakness  and  began   to  increase  their  battle  achievements.</p>
<p>Originally,  the  star  array  calculation  formation  was  perfect,  thanks  to   phantom  path,  Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones  were  not  able  to  attack  it  easily.   But  now  that  they  had  made  a  crucial  breakthrough,  there  was  a  hole  in  the   perfect  structure  and  they  started  to  attack  using  it.</p>
<p>A  Gu  Immortal  in  charge  of  healing  arrived  in  front  of  Zhang  Ji  and  began   to  treat  him.</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji  was  downcast  as  he  berated  himself  while  coughing  blood:  ”I  am   unworthy  of  Heavenly  Court’s  support  and  Lady  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  trust,  I  lost  the  formation  core!”</p>
<p>The  healer  Gu  Immortal  consoled  him:  ”This  was  all  due  to  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable’s  killer  move,  it  is  not  your  fault.”</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji  had  an  incredulous  expression:  ”This  luck  path  killer  move  is  truly   insidious,  it  connected  all  the  variables  and  expanded  them  until  even  the   formation  core  Immortal  Gu  was  harmed.”</p>
<p>It  was  like  a  scale  where  if  one  end  was  weighed  down,  the  other  end  would   rise.  The  formation  cores’  Immortal  Gu  and  the  surrounding  mortal  Gu   were  like  an  integral  whole  made  from  countless  carrying  poles.</p>
<p>But  instead  of  raising  one  end  when  the  other  was  pushed  down,  another   weight  was  added  to  suppress  the  rising  end,  these  two  variables  canceled   each  other.</p>
<p>Nothing  is  certain  except  success  acted  the  opposite  way,  it  united  the   power  of  all  the  variables,  thus  destroying  the  formation  core’s  Immortal   Gu.</p>
<p>After  healing  for  a  while,  Zhang  Ji’s  situation  was  finally  stable.</p>
<p>Over  this  period,  another  three  formation  cores  of  the  star  array  calculation   formation  were  destroyed  by  Fang  Yuan’s  clones.</p>
<p>“This  is  all  my  fault!”  Zhang  Ji  blamed  himself  even  more,  he  felt  that  the   situation  was  crumbling  apart.</p>
<p>But  at  this  time,  another  Gu  Immortal  arrived  beside  him.</p>
<p>This  was  a  formation  path  grandmaster:  ”The  situation  is  urgent,  I  came  to   repair  the  formation  and  will  need  your  assistance.”</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji  quickly  cupped  his  fists  in  greeting,  expressing  he  would  stake   everything  to  help.</p>
<p>Although  the  formation  core’s  Immortal  Gu  was  destroyed,  this  formation   path  grandmaster  could  use  immortal  materials,  to  set  up  a  formation  that   could  temporarily  replace  the  position  of  the  destroyed  formation  core’s   Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>It  was  not  easy  to  construct  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  Star   Constellation’s  will  was  not  willing  to  see  it  be  destroyed.  Central   Continent’s  ten  great  sects’  Gu  Immortals  had  tasted  the  benefits  of  this   formation  and  were  also  not  willing  to  see  its  destruction.</p>
