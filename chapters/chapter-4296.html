        <p>:  Pursuing  the  Rank  Nine  Immortal  Gu</p>
<p>This  change  had  occurred  too  quickly.</p>
<p>Even  the  three  venerables  could  not  take  action  in  time.</p>
<p>Their  original  plan  was  to  wait  for  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  to  go   down  with  the  sun,  until  they  were  both  greatly  weakened.  Because  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  following  his  instincts  now,  he  would  also  want   to  survive  naturally.  Thus,  if  he  got  badly  injured,  he  would  escape.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  the  three  venerables  would  target  the  greatly  weakened   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>In  the  contest  of  three  venerables,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  a   huge  uncertainty.  There  was  still  a  chance  of  him  regaining  his  sanity,  thus,   the  three  venerables  were  in  agreement  that  this  uncertainty  should  be  killed   first.</p>
<p>Like  during  the  battle  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  decided  to  cooperate  to  kill   all  the  pseudo  venerables  first.</p>
<p>But  out  of  their  expectations,  the  sun  actually  exploded  first.</p>
<p>Different  from  what  everyone  thought,  the  sun  actually  contained  two  rank   nine  Immortal  Gu  and  one  mysterious  legendary  immemorial  desolate   beast.</p>
<p>The  sun’s  foundation  far  exceeded  their  expectations.</p>
<p>With  this  foundation  and  the  fact  that  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was   not  sane,  it  should  be  very  hard  to  deal  with,  he  would  be  the  one  to  escape   first.</p>
<p>But  the  issue  was  that  the  legendary  immemorial  desolate  beast  that  hid   inside  the  sun  got  shocked  and  escaped.</p>
<p>Not  only  did  it  run  away,  it  even  brought  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  with  it.</p>
<p>Once  this  Immortal  Gu  was  taken,  the  sun  lacked  a  core  and  its  stable   condition  quickly  destabilized  spontaneous.</p>
<p>“No  matter  how  strong  a  Gu  house  is,  it  can  still  be  easily  broken  from  the   inside.”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sighed  as  she  thought  of  a   logic  in  the  Gu  world.</p>
<p>This  abrupt  change  disrupted  her  plan.</p>
<p>Among  the  three  venerables,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  the   one  who  wanted  to  kill  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  the  most.</p>
<p>Because  she  understood  the  threat  that  he  held  towards  Heavenly  Court!</p>
<p>Originally,  she  wanted  to  give  in  and  accept  some  losses  to  lure  the  other   two  venerables  into  attacking  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  killing   him.  But  to  think  that  this  happened.</p>
<p>Fire  Gu  was  a  legendary  Immortal  Gu  recorded  in  <<The  Legends  of  Ren   Zu>>,  it  was  rank  nine  but  got  devoured  by  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>Forget  about  that  for  now,  but  the  mysterious  legendary  immemorial   desolate  beast  also  brought  away  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>It  had  to  be  pursued.</p>
<p>A  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  was  concerned,  while  a  legendary  immemorial   beast  was  not  hard  to  deal  with  for  a  venerable.</p>
<p>Because  it  was  too  easy  to  succeed,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   had  to  race  against  time  now.</p>
<p>There  were  three  venerables  in  the  world,  she  did  not  want  the  Immortal  Gu   to  end  up  with  the  other  venerables.</p>
<p>“Be  careful,  fire  is  raining  down  like  a  storm.”  Fairy  Bai  Qing  was  the  first   to  alert  the  others.</p>
<p>“Oh  no,  what  do  we  do?”  Rainbow  Butterfly  Immortal  Concubine  looked  at   the  sky  and  saw  countless  flames  descending,  she  felt  lost  and  helpless.</p>
<p>These  flames  were  too  high  ranked.</p>
<p>Bright  light  glorious  ring  fire  made  up  most  of  these  flames,  this  was  the   heaven  flame  of  the  three  flames  in  the  world,  it  was  a  rank  nine  fire  path   immortal  material!</p>
<p>One  had  to  be  a  rank  eight  fire  path  great  expert  at  least  to  deal  with  it.</p>
<p>But  in  the  sky  above  Central  Continent,  there  was  a  colossal  immortal   formation.</p>
<p>Central  Continent’s  Gu  Immortals  wanted  to  defend  the  formation  so  they   had  to  deal  with  these  flames.</p>
<p>“Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  please  give  us  the  orders.”   Shi  Lei  shouted  loudly.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  sighed  softly  as  she  left  behind  her  will  and  some  rank   nine  immortal  essence,  controlling  Embroidered  Tower  to  deal  with  the   situation  here.</p>
<p>But  her  main  body  had  left  already,  heading  for  the  two  heavens.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  currently  using  investigative  methods  to  observe  the  five   regions.</p>
<p>“With  the  collapse  of  the  sun,  countless  immortal  materials  are  scattered   everywhere.  Among  them,  the  light  path  resources  are  mostly  flying  around   in  the  two  heavens  while  the  fire  path  resources  are  scattered  onto  the  five   regions.”</p>
<p>“Fire  rain  is  most  common  in  Western  Desert  while  least  common  in   Eastern  Sea.”</p>
<p>The  reason  was  simple.</p>
<p>Conflict  of  dao  marks.</p>
<p>In  the  five  regions,  Eastern  Sea  had  the  most  water  path  dao  marks,  while   Western  Desert  had  the  most  fire  path  dao  marks.  Thus,  the  fire  rain   preferred  to  target  Western  Desert  instead.</p>
<p>“These  flames  are  top  tier  resources,  if  they  are  gathered  to  a  certain  size,   they  can  be  made  into  fire  path  resource  points.”</p>
<p>“Especially  the  bright  light  glorious  ring  fire,  this  rank  nine  immortal   material  is  extremely  rare  and  barely  found  anywhere.  It  is  a  prime   opportunity  to  gain  a  huge  amount  of  it  now,  I  need  to  make  use  of  this.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  immediately  ordered  his  Gu  Immortals  to  head  to  various   locations  to  collect  the  fire  path  resources.</p>
<p>But  regrettably,  he  had  the  most  water  path  Gu  Immortals  and  only  a  few   fire  path  Gu  Immortals,  not  to  mention  rank  eight  fire  path  cultivators.</p>
<p>Regarding  this,  Fang  Yuan  used  his  will  in  treasure  yellow  heaven  to  make   an  announcement:</p>
<p>“Good  news,  good  news!  The  Heaven  and  Earth  Great  Love  Alliance  is   holding  an  event!”</p>
<p>“Anyone  who  collects  enough  fire  path  immortal  materials  can  exchange   them  with  us  for  alliance  contribution  points.”</p>
<p>“If  you  collect  enough  alliance  contribution  points,  you  will  be  able  to  join   the  Heaven  and  Earth  Great  Love  Alliance  officially,  it  will  not  cost  you   resource  points!”</p>
<p>“After  joining  the  alliance,  you  will  also  retain  the  contribution  points  from   exchanging  immortal  materials.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  will  tossed  out  a  list  that  wrote  the  details  of  each  exchange   clearly.  Bright  light  glorious  ring  fire  was  listed  at  the  top,  it  could   exchange  for  the  most  contribution  points.</p>
<p>The  Gu  Immortals  of  the  world  heard  the  announcement  and  instantly   became  moved.</p>
<p>Originally,  joining  the  Heaven  and  Earth  Great  Love  Alliance  required   resource  points,  but  now,  all  they  had  to  do  was  to  collect  fire  path  immortal   materials.</p>
<p>For  the  bulk  of  the  Gu  Immortals,  the  entry  requirement  fell  once  again.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  will  added:  ”This  event  will  only  last  for  a  short  while,  the   fastest  ones  will  gain  the  most,  once  I  collect  enough  fire  path  immortal   materials,  this  event  will  end  immediately.”</p>
<p>“Fire  path  immortal  material?  What  a  pity,  other  than  the  bright  light   glorious  ring  fire,  if  I  go  to  collect  the  other  fire  path  immortal  materials,   the  gains  will  be  lower  than  just  collecting  heaven  path  immortal   materials.”  In  the  two  heavens,  Shen  Shang  was  busy  scavenging  for   resources.</p>
<p>“Are  we  not  pursuing  Fang  clan  anymore?”</p>
<p>“For  what?  Let  Heavenly  Court’s  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  do  it.  Let’s  quickly   collect  these  fire  path  immortal  materials,  we  can  use  some  ourselves  while   selling  the  rest  to  Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable.  This  opportunity  will  not   knock  twice!”</p>
<p>More  and  more  Gu  Immortals  in  Western  Desert  started  to  move  out.</p>
<p>Southern  Border.</p>
<p>Wu  Yong  led  Wu  clan’s  Gu  Immortals  as  they  started  to  move  around  with   lightning  speed.</p>
<p>Benefits  tempted  everyone,  a  large  number  of  Gu  Immortals  in  the  five   regions  were  mobilized  by  Fang  Yuan  as  a  result.</p>
<p>As  for  Fang  Yuan,  he  personally  headed  into  the  two  heavens.</p>
<p>The  destruction  of  the  sun  also  affected  his  plan.  Originally,  he  wanted  to   wait  for  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  the  sun  to  both  get  weakened.   If  his  refinement  of  heavenly  secret  Gu  succeeded  in  time,  he  would  be  able   to  gain  some  benefits  from  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>But  now,  he  had  to  refine  heavenly  secret  Gu  while  keeping  up  with  the   facade.</p>
<p>Thus,  he  had  to  enter  the  two  heavens  and  pretend  that  he  was  trying  to  go   after  the  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>This  was  the  normal  reaction  and  behavior  that  he  should  have.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   were  brilliant  people,  Fang  Yuan  had  to  do  this  to  avoid  exposing  himself.</p>
<p>After  the  sun  was  destroyed,  the  five  regions  became  dim.</p>
<p>Mortal  Gu  Masters  were  fearful  and  shocked  while  other  lifeforms  also   panicked,  the  crying  and  growling  of  beasts  and  birds  could  be  heard   everywhere.</p>
<p>This  was  an  unprecedented  change!</p>
<p>A  large  scale  panic  was  unavoidable.</p>
<p>Starlight  flickered  randomly  as  a  legendary  immemorial  desolate  beast   charged  out  while  bathed  in  blood.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  the  first  to  arrive,  she  waved  her   hand  as  the  blood  and  scales  that  were  left  in  the  air  gathered  in  her  hands.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  quickly  made  deductions  with  her   wisdom  path  immortal  killer  move.</p>
<p>“This  is  You  Tian  Guang?!”  She  quickly  deduced  the  identity  of  this   legendary  immemorial  beast,  she  felt  a  little  shocked.</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  and  Zuo  Ye  Hui  had  once  terrorized  the  five  regions,  they   whipped  up  a  bloody  storm.  They  were  extremely  crafty,  they  worked   together  and  whenever  a  Demon  Venerable  or  Immortal  Venerable  was   alive,  they  would  hide  and  not  show  up.</p>
<p>But  eventually,  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  brought  peace  to  the   world  and  killed  You  Tian  Guang.</p>
<p>This  was  recorded  in  history.</p>
<p>“But  You  Tian  Guang  is  actually  alive,  did  it  fake  its  death?”</p>
<p>“Could  it  fake  its  death  in  front  of  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable?  Or   does  that  mean…  this  is  part  of  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable’s   arrangement?”</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  thought  of  many   things.</p>
<p>The  situation  had  gotten  quite  mysterious  and  complex.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  pursued  the  beast  while  analyzing  to   herself.</p>
<p>The  more  she  thought  about  it,  the  more  she  felt  that  this  was  Paradise  Earth   Immortal  Venerable’s  move!</p>
<p>According  to  the  situation  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  originally,  once  Paradise   Earth  Immortal  Venerable  revived,  he  would  become  a  heaven  path   venerable.  That  would  allow  him  to  gain  an  immense  advantage  in  the  two   heavens.  Especially  after  he  refines  all  the  heaven  path  dao  marks  in  the   two  heavens,  he  would  be  able  to  control  all  the  heaven  vein  nodes.</p>
<p>By  then,  Heavenly  Court  and  Longevity  Heaven  would  be  greatly   threatened  by  him!</p>
<p>The  sun  was  also  a  heaven  vein  node.</p>
<p>Back  then,  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  intentionally  placed  You   Tian  Guang  inside  the  sun  as  an  arrangement  for  him  to  capture  the  sun  in   the  future.</p>
<p>“Thankfully,  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  is  dead  now.  From  this   aspect,  I  should  thank  Fang  Yuan  instead?”  The  moment  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  thought  of  Fang  Yuan,  he  appeared  before  her.</p>
<p>“Friend  Star  Constellation,  we  meet  again.”  Fang  Yuan  smiled  as  he   greeted.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly  internally  but  she   showed  a  kind  smile  on  her  face,  her  demeanor  was  extremely  elegant.</p>
<p>The  two  had  a  warm  attitude  but  their  movements  did  not  slow  down,   instead,  they  moved  even  faster.</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  were  guarded  against  each  other  as  they  attacked  You   Tian  Guang.</p>
<p>This  You  Tian  Guang  had  human  form,  its  back  was  bent  and  its  forearms   were  long,  there  was  a  horn  on  its  head  and  its  body  was  covered  in  scales   that  resembled  countless  mirrors  that  reflected  light  in  all  directions.</p>
<p>Under  the  pursuit  of  both  venerables,  You  Tian  Guang  actually  managed  to   escape  time  and  again.</p>
<p>“As  I  expected,  You  Tian  Guang  brought  away  rank  nine  light  Gu!  It  has   not  been  refined  yet,  this  is  still  a  wild  Immortal  Gu.”  Fang  Yuan  noticed</p>
<p>the  peculiarity.</p>
<p>He  sighed  internally.</p>
<p>Inside  sovereign  immortal  aperture,  the  refinement  of  heavenly  secret   Immortal  Gu  had  reached  a  crucial  moment.</p>
<p>He  did  not  want  to  go  after  this  rank  nine  light  Gu.</p>
<p>If  he  obtained  it,  the  two  venerables  would  attack  him  in  a  frenzy  to  try  and   snatch  it.</p>
<p>After  all,  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  was  able  to  break  the  balance  between   the  three  venerables!</p>
<p>Nobody  wanted  this  Immortal  Gu  to  end  up  in  another’s  hands.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  had  to  say  what  he  had  to  say:  ”You  Tian  Guang,  I  am  best   friends  with  your  master  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable.  After  he  died,   he  gave  his  inheritance  to  me  but  did  not  have  time  to  tell  me  about  you.   Quickly  leave  with  me,  I  will  ensure  your  safety!”</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  coughed  out  blood  while  shouting:  ”That  old  bastard   Paradise  Earth,  I  was  almost  beaten  to  death  by  him,  it  took  all  my  effort  to   hide  in  the  sun  to  recuperate.  I  only  managed  to  recover  a  little  after   sleeping  for  so  many  years.  He  did  this  to  me,  I  will  definitely  not  submit  to   you!”</p>
<p>“That  means  this  is  not  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable’s  arrangement?”   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  slightly  stunned,  she  could   sense  You  Tian  Guang’s  emotions,  it  was  not  lying.</p>
<p>“You  Tian  Guang  was  able  to  escape  by  faking  death  in  front  of  Paradise   Earth  Immortal  Venerable,  it  is  quite  amazing.”  Light  Emperor  who  was   hiding  nearby  thought  to  himself.</p>
<p>He  was  hiding  inside  a  black  cloud,  at  this  moment,  he  did  not  want  to   dazzle  anyone.</p>
