        <p>:  Fang  Yuan  and  Giant  Sun  Fight  Star  Constellation</p>
<p>Intense  wind  blew  as  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  hair  fluttered   behind  her.</p>
<p>She  frowned  slightly  as  the  image  of  Heavenly  Court  was  reflected  in  her   dark  pupils.</p>
<p>In  her  memory,  Heavenly  Court  had  never  been  in  such  a  distressed  state.</p>
<p>The  star  fog  got  denser  as  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  who  was   trapped  inside,  growled  and  roared,  he  was  increasingly  furious  and  insane,   but  he  could  not  escape  from  the  star  fog.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  bullying  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable’s  lack  of  sanity,  if  he  was  conscious,  he  would  not  do  such  a   thing.</p>
<p>She  was  currently  inside  Heavenly  Court,  with  the  amplification  of  the   wisdom  path  dao  marks,  she  was  completely  above  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  in  power.</p>
<p>If  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  fought  without  any  intention  to  retreat,  it   was  likely  for  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  use  the  territorial   advantage  to  kill  him!</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  showed  no  joy  on  her  face.</p>
<p>Ever  since  the  qi  explosion,  she  knew  that  Heavenly  Court’s  greatest  danger   was  not  the  insane  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  but  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  and  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>Between  the  two,  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  was  the  most   threatening.</p>
<p>Although  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  no  evidence  regarding   the  explosion  of  the  qi  harvest  fruit,  she  was  clear  that  Fang  Yuan  was  the   most  suspicious  one.</p>
<p>He  would  not  let  this  chance  slip  by.</p>
<p>Neither  would  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>If  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  revived,  the  balance  of  the  three   venerables  would  be  overturned,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  would  not   want  this  to  happen.  Earlier,  he  withdrew  because  there  was  no  hope.</p>
<p>But  now,  the  situation  changed  after  the  explosion,  Heavenly  Court  was   covered  in  holes,  it  was  basically  defenseless.</p>
<p>The  only  concern  that  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  was  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  herself.</p>
<p>But  in  order  to  protect  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  endured  most  of  the  force  of  the  explosion,  she  was  currently   injured.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  she  could  not  defeat  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  in  a   short  period  of  time,  this  gave  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Heaven   Refining  Demon  Venerable  sufficient  time  to  probe  her  current  condition.</p>
<p>As  expected,  once  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  used  her  star  fog   to  trap  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and   Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  arrived.</p>
<p>In  the  battle  regarding  the  dream  realms  in  spectral  heaven  earlier,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  allied  with  Giant  Sun  Immortal</p>
<p>Venerable,  but  now,  she  was  all  alone  against  the  assault  three  venerables.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  floated  in  the  sky  quietly,  she   watched  as  Fang  Yuan  and  Giant  Sun  arrived.</p>
<p>Her  gaze  swept  past  Giant  Sun  and  fixed  on  Fang  Yuan,  she  said:  ”Heaven   Refining  Demon  Venerable,  you  are  worthily  a  refinement  path  venerable,   you  tampered  with  the  qi  harvest  fruit  to  cause  the  explosion.  But  I  have   one  question,  how  are  you  so  clear  of  my  master’s  revival  arrangements  in   Heavenly  Court?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  first  stunned  before  laughing:  ”Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable,  you  are  overestimating  me.  Remember,  the  current  world  is  no   longer  like  ancient  times,  the  five  regions  have  become  one  while  the  two   heavens  became  spectral  heaven.  Isn’t  it  normal  for  revival  methods  made   three  million  years  ago  by  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  to  fail?”</p>
<p>“You  can  think  whatever  you  want,  that  is  none  of  my  concern,  but  I  won’t   give  you  any  time  to  stall  further,  take  this!”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  that  he  was  the  culprit  but  he  had  to  make  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  stand  on  his  side,  so  he  was  not  going  to  let  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  talk  anymore.</p>
<p>Once  he  stepped  into  Heavenly  Court,  Fang  Yuan  unleashed  a  powerful   offensive  method.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and   Dang  Hun  Sound!</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  was  already  placed  into  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture,   now  that  he  regained  dream  armor  Immortal  Gu,  this  move  could  be  used   once  again.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  waves  of  pink  fog  emerged  from  Fang  Yuan’s  mouth   and  ears,  gathering  above  Fang  Yuan’s  head  and  turning  into  a  small  image   of  Dang  Hun  Mountain.</p>
<p>The  small  Dang  Hun  Mountain  shook  intensely.</p>
<p>Ding—— ！</p>
<p>Ding—— ！</p>
<p>Ding—— ！</p>
<p>Sounds  of  clear  crystals  colliding  resounded  in  the  battlefield,  and  soon,   waves  of  pink  sound  waves  spread  throughout  the  area.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  who  was  trapped  in  the  star  fog  also   suffered  the  attack  of  the  pink  sound  waves.</p>
<p>However,  the  star  fog  managed  to  stabilize  after  weakening  by  thirty   percent.  It  rumbled  intensely,  seemingly  adapting  and  enduring  the  assault   of  the  powerful  pink  sound  waves.</p>
<p>Seeing  this,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  helped  out  from  the  side.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Soft  Gold  Crashing  Pillar!</p>
<p>Golden  light  flowed  and  turned  into  tens  of  crashing  pillars  that  slammed   into  the  star  fog.</p>
<p>The  strong  impact  of  the  soft  gold  crashing  pillars  made  the  luck  of  the  star   fog  shake  intensely.</p>
<p>Everything  in  heaven  and  earth  contained  luck,  even  grass  and  rocks  were   no  exception.</p>
<p>This  was  the  profundity  of  heaven  and  earth  luck.</p>
<p>The  luck  of  the  star  fog  was  attacked,  it  influenced  the  star  fog  itself,  this   penetrative  force  started  to  disrupt  the  operations  of  the  star  fog.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  once  used  this  move  on  Fang  Yuan,  at   that  time,  it  was  not  completed  yet  but  it  still  gave  Fang  Yuan  significant   trouble.  Now,  the  move  was  already  in  a  completed  state.</p>
<p>However,  under  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  control,  although   the  star  fog  shook  for  a  while,  it  still  survived  the  waves  of  attacks.</p>
<p>This  scene  made  Fang  Yuan’s  and  Giant  Sun’s  hearts  sink.</p>
<p>In  any  other  location,  these  two  moves  would  have  succeeded.  But  in   Heavenly  Court,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  the   amplification  of  Heavenly  Court’s  vast  number  of  wisdom  path  dao  marks,   her  strength  rose  to  a  terrifying  level.</p>
<p>The  star  fog  was  not  her  strongest  killer  move,  but  using  it,  she  resisted   Fang  Yuan’s  compound  killer  move  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s   new  method.</p>
<p>“With  me  here,  Heavenly  Court  will  not  lose.”  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  said  plainly,  but  her  tone  was  filled  with  confidence  and  resolve.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  suppressed  the  two  Demon   Venerables,  Giant  Sun  and  Fang  Yuan,  on  her  own!”</p>
<p>“That’s  right,  all  of  Heavenly  Court’s  wisdom  path  dao  marks  have  been   refined  by  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.”</p>
<p>“Hmph,  no  matter  how  much  damage  Heavenly  Court  has  taken,  these   demonic  path  scoundrels  cannot  take  us  down.”</p>
<p>“After  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  died,  she  left  behind   three  measures  to  block  the  attack  of  three  Demon  Venerables  for  Heavenly   Court.  Now  that  she  is  alive  and  is  personally  stopping  them,  she  can   definitely  defend  Heavenly  Court,  these  Demon  Venerables  will  not   succeed.”</p>
<p>The  Gu  Immortals  of  the  ten  great  ancient  sects  were  excited,  the  Heavenly   Court  members  also  showed  expressions  of  joy.</p>
<p>Everyone  knew  about  the  details  of  the  battle  over  spectral  heaven’s  dream   realms.</p>
<p>The  immortals  saw  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  strength   had  risen,  they  were  joyous  and  felt  more  confident  now.</p>
<p>But  at  the  next  moment,  the  immortals  heard  Fang  Yuan’s  cold  voice:  ”Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  Heavenly  Court  is  your  strongest   territory,  but  it  is  also  your  weakness!  Take  this!”</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Arrival  of  Dragon  Snake  with  Dust  Fog  and   Explosive  Soul  Wind!</p>
<p>Soul  fog  spread  out  as  dragons  and  snakes  roared.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  the  small  Dang  Hun  Mountain  above  Fang  Yuan’s  head   shot  out  countless  pink  sound  waves  again.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  used  two  moves  at  once,  but  he  did  not  target  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable,  instead,  he  aimed  at  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  expression  changed,  she  quickly   used  methods  to  block  them.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  two  moves  worked  together  but  were  stopped  by  her  midway,   however,  he  laughed,  he  held  the  initiative  now.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  moved  like  lightning,  he  quickly  went  to  one   side  and  aimed  at  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core  as  he  attacked.</p>
<p>After  the  earlier  test,  they  realized  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  was  too  powerful  here,  Giant  Sun  and  Fang  Yuan  could  not   defeat  her  even  if  they  worked  together.</p>
<p>But  it  did  not  matter.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  most  worried  about  Primordial  Origin   Immortal  Venerable’s  revival.</p>
<p>As  long  as  he  destroyed  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core  and  successfully  retreated,   his  goal  would  be  achieved,  he  would  win  this  fight.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  fell  into  a  passive  spot  indeed.</p>
<p>She  had  to  concentrate  on  defending  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core,  although  she   was  strongest  while  in  Heavenly  Court,  she  could  only  defend  now.</p>
<p>After  seeing  this,  the  Central  Continent  Gu  Immortals  gritted  their  teeth  and   scolded  continuously.</p>
<p>“They  are  so  shameless!”</p>
<p>“To  think  that  the  grand  Giant  Sun  would  act  like  this.”</p>
<p>“Sigh,  I  really  want  to  help  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,   but  I  am  just  too  weak.”</p>
<p>The  battle  of  venerables  caused  huge  aftermath  effects,  the  various   Immortal  Gu  Houses  retreated  time  and  again.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  was  situated  in  Demon  Judgment  Board,  he  frowned   deeply  as  he  locked  his  gaze  on  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  was  doing  the  same.</p>
<p>The  Ma  Hong  Yun  that  she  loved  had  died  in  Fang  Yuan’s  arms.  Fang  Yuan   was  currently  in  possession  of  Ma  Hong  Yun’s  soul,  so  even  with  fate  Gu   destroyed,  Zhao  Lian  Yun  could  not  revive  him.</p>
<p>She  had  to  get  back  Ma  Hong  Yun  from  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>“Maybe,  I  can  use  the  power  of  love  Gu  to  steal  his  soul  from  Fang  Yuan’s   immortal  aperture.  After  all,  love  Gu  is  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,  it  has   countless  effects  and  is  capable  of  doing  almost  anything!”</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  thought  of  this  and  felt  increasingly  moved.</p>
<p>“Now  is  not  the  time.  I  need  to  wait  patiently  until  Fang  Yuan  is  at  his   weakest,  when  he  cannot  afford  to  distract  himself,  I  will  make  a  move!”</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  was  waiting  to  strike.</p>
<p>She  had  the  killer  move  luck  gamble,  it  was  created  to  counter  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>She  could  not  do  anything  against  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  but  she   could  deal  with  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>She  was  waiting  for  a  chance.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan,  what  other  methods  do  you  still  have?  Hurry  up  and  use   them.”  After  attacking  for  a  long  time  with  no  results,  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  started  to  get  anxious,  he  shouted  towards  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  looked  down  at  the  Heavenly  Court  below  him.</p>
<p>He  saw  many  Immortal  Gu  Houses  and  also  huge  areas  of  ruins.</p>
<p>He  laughed  ruthlessly  as  he  said:  ”Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  I   am  going  to  kill  all  of  Heavenly  Court’s  Gu  Immortals  now.  Come  stop  me   if  you  can!”</p>
