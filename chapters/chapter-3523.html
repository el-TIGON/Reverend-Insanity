    <p>Taking Blame Even In Death</p>
<p>Fixed Immortal Travel was finally regained!</p>
<p>This way, even if Fang Yuan rose to rank eight and lost future self, he did not have to worry about losing Fixed Immortal Travel’s movement method.</p>
<p>Fixed Immortal Travel was a powerful movement Immortal Gu that was extremely useful to Fang Yuan.</p>
<p>In the previous life, Fang Yuan deduced a killer move with Fixed Immortal Travel as the core, even as a rank eight, he could travel all over the world and cause great chaos.</p>
<p>With this Immortal Gu, he would have incredibly powerful maneuverability!</p>
<p>But in the previous life, Fang Yuan stole Fixed Immortal Travel with one attempt, this time, it was truly troublesome, he used great thief ghost hand more than ten times, a lot of immortal essence was expended.</p>
<p>The flaw of great thief ghost hand was evident.</p>
<p>Even though it could steal Immortal Gu, it would steal mortal Gu in most cases. Fang Yuan stole tens of thousands of mortal Gu from Feng Jiu Ge, but only three or four Immortal Gu.</p>
<p>“Next is fate armor Immortal Gu.” Fang Yuan’s cold gaze was fixed on Feng Jiu Ge.</p>
<p>As long as he stole fate armor Immortal Gu, Feng Jiu Ge would be finished.</p>
<p>Feng Jiu Ge continued to escape.</p>
<p>He had never thought that he would end up in such a distressed state!</p>
<p>“Fang Yuan knows me very well! He has been trying to steal my Immortal Gu without attacking much, he is targeting my weakness, he knows the power of fate armor Immortal Gu.”</p>
<p>Feng Jiu Ge’s heart sank to rock bottom, an intense chill permeated in his body.</p>
<p>The more Immortal Gu he lost, the more his battle strength fell.</p>
<p>“Fang Yuan!” Feng Jiu Ge thought about this name in his mind. Even though he had some estimation towards Fang Yuan’s growth, he did not not that he would be forced to escape without a way of fighting back.</p>
<p>Back then, Feng Jiu Ge was chasing after Fang Yuan from Southern Border to Western Desert, it seemed just like yesterday, Feng Jiu Ge could still remember clearly.</p>
<p>But to think that now, their situations were reversed!</p>
<p>“Such immense growth!” Feng Jiu Ge sighed in his heart.</p>
<p>It was not that Feng Jiu Ge was not strong, but Fang Yuan’s preparations were simply too plentiful.</p>
<p>He did not expose his secret of rebirth, his advantage was well kept.</p>
<p>The super formation in Lang Ya blessed land was modified by Fang Yuan, it was many times stronger than in the previous life.</p>
<p>One of the reason was that Fang Yuan controlled Lang Ya blessed land, he could mobilize all of its resources to build the immortal formation, he could also transact with the three variant human races.</p>
<p>The second reason was that Fang Yuan was much stronger than in the previous life at this point in time, be it formation path or time path, he was far superior.</p>
<p>This allowed him to create this super formation to trap Feng Jiu Ge and Chen Yi.</p>
<p>At the other end.</p>
<p>Chen Yi’s eyes flickered with light, he was moving around in the illusory mazes.</p>
<p>“Damn it! I am still trapped after so long!” Chen Yi was lost in the illusory mazes, even though he moved around quickly and broke many illusions, he still felt like vomiting blood.</p>
<p>This formation constantly refreshed Chen Yi’s evaluation towards it.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan arranged almost all the variant human Gu Immortals to control the formation and target Chen Yi.</p>
<p>Even though he had great battle strength with immortal killer moves like ancient tree prison cage, giant tree divine statue, karma divine tree, and others, making it very difficult for Fang Yuan to handle these superb killer moves.</p>
<p>In the previous life, Chen Yi fought against two enemies alone, facing the immemorial rock dragon and Heavenly Giant Solor, his performance was incredible and breathtaking.</p>
<p>But now, Fang Yuan obtained control of Lang Ya Sect entirely, he arranged the immemorial rock dragon and Heavenly Giant Solor to deal with Chen Yi but the two were merely assisting, the main thing dealing with Chen Yi was the super formation.</p>
<p>As Chen Yi struggled in the illusory maze, every time he had hope of breaking out, the immemorial rock dragon or Heavenly Giant Solor would appear to obstruct him and stall for time.</p>
<p>Next, the variant human Gu Immortals would create more layers and mazes, causing Chen Yi to stay trapped indefinitely.</p>
<p>Chen Yi’s methods were all unusable as a result.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan targeted him specifically, easily countering him.</p>
<p>Chen Yi was very anxious now, the longer this dragged on, the more uneasy he felt.</p>
<p>Was the Thunder Ghost True Monarch corpse earlier just an illusion?</p>
<p>Chen Yi was not certain!</p>
<p>He wanted to believe that it was an illusion.</p>
<p>The reason was simple, with Thunder Ghost True Monarch’s battle strength, how could Fang Yuan possibly kill her immediately?</p>
<p>Were there other possibilities?</p>
<p>If Thunder Ghost True Monarch was still alive, why had she shown no commotion at all after such a long time in this battle?</p>
<p>Right now, he and Feng Jiu Ge were isolated, a long time had passed, how was the situation on his end?</p>
<p>“Unless, the dream realm?” Chen Yi had a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>He did not know that Fang Yuan possessed rank eight steal life Immortal Gu, but he knew that Fang Yuan was skilled at using the self-detonation of Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies to form dream realms and deal with strong enemies.</p>
<p>During the battle at Yi Tian Mountain, Spectral Soul was captured by Heavenly Court. Afterwards, Fang Yuan was pursued by Wu Yong and Feng Jiu Ge, he used the Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies to escape many times.</p>
<p>Without the Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies, Fang Yuan would have died on the way already.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei was a wisdom path great expert, before this trip, she had already made deductions. Fang Yuan’s dream realms, Reverse Flow River, and others were all in her consideration.</p>
<p>The dark spiral was the tracer for star cast, it had detection abilities. If there were dream realms or Reverse Flow River nearby, Fairy Zi Wei could sense it.</p>
<p>In fact, Fang Yuan could not truly control the dream realm or Reverse Flow River precisely. Once the Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies self- detonate, they would create an expanding dream realm that moved on its own, he could also only move Reverse Flow River mildly.</p>
<p>Be it the dream realm or Reverse Flow River, as long as the dark spiral was in contact with them, star cast killer move would become unstable and fail.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei only had to create a slightly larger dark spiral to test if there were dream realms or Reverse Flow River around it.</p>
<p>“It is stupid to only use the dream realms or Reverse Flow River as a trap, but what if Fang Yuan created new dream path killer moves? He has Spring Autumn Cicada, he had been reborn from the future after all!” Chen Yi thought.</p>
<p>But the truth was, Fang Yuan currently had no dream realms with him.</p>
<p>His Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies had all been consumed. (Refer to</p>
