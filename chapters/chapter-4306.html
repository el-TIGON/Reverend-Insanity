    <p>:  Three  Venerables  Scheme  Against</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul</p>
<p>In  the  starry  sky,  countless  stars  that  resembled  a  sea  floated  above  Central   Continent.</p>
<p>The  pale  blue  light  of  the  stars  weaved  together  to  form  an  illusory  view.</p>
<p>If  one  look  at  the  five  regions  from  above  now,  Northern  Plains,  Southern   Border,  Western  Desert,  and  Eastern  Sea  would  be  shrouded  in  darkness,   while  the  center  was  shining  brightly  with  specks  of  light.</p>
<p>Central  Continent  was  a  clear  contrast  from  the  other  regions.</p>
<p>Starlight  radiated  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Compared  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  had  a  clear  understanding  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  in   his  current  condition,  she  had  started  to  make  plans  from  long  ago.</p>
<p>Even  Fang  Yuan  was  behind  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  in   deducing  the  true  condition  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>This  was  the  power  of  foresight  and  planning  that  wisdom  path  excelled  in.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  stayed  inside  Embroidered  Tower.</p>
<p>She  was  currently  multi-tasking,  refining  Central  Continent’s  natural   wisdom  path  dao  marks,  healing  herself,  controlling  the  star  array   calculation  formation,  and  even  handling  the  internal  affairs  of  Heavenly   Court.</p>
<p>This  was  the  advantage  of  wisdom  path  —  an  abundance  of  thoughts!</p>
<p>The  star  array  calculation  formation  slowly  operated  normally  with  no   issues.</p>
<p>Although  this  formation  only  had  basic  offensive  and  defensive  abilities   that  could  not  even  reach  pseudo  venerable  level,  it  was  for  this  reason  that   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable  chose  to   make  a  transaction  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  instead  of   destroying  it,  obtaining  benefits  instead.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  a  huge  desire  for  blood  path  related   results,  while  Fang  Yuan  wanted  Primordial  Domain.</p>
<p>The  star  array  calculation  formation’s  main  power  was  to  collect   information  in  Central  Continent  through  the  wide  area  that  it  enveloped,   through  deductions,  they  could  mobilize  Central  Continent  Gu  Immortals  to   cooperate  seamlessly.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  the  number  one  person  in   wisdom  path,  in  fact,  wisdom  path  was  created  by  her,  and  now,  she  was   still  the  number  one  wisdom  path  Gu  Immortal.  Nobody  understood   wisdom  path  more  than  her!</p>
<p>Wisdom  path  emphasized  on  control,  it  researched  upon  certainty.</p>
<p>Wisdom  path  had  three  main  elements:  thoughts,  wills,  and  emotions.</p>
<p>Thoughts  were  ever-changing,  wills  were  intense,  while  emotions   interrupted,  wisdom  path  cultivation  meant  having  control  over  these  three   aspects!</p>
<p>This  was  the  most  basic  thing.</p>
<p>Thus,  wisdom  path  cultivators  were  often  calm  and  composed,  they  knew   how  to  handle  their  own  state  of  mind.</p>
<p>On  this  basis,  wisdom  path  Gu  cultivators  could  handle  information  by   storing  them  or  understanding  certain  things,  this  allowed  them  to  control   the  present.</p>
<p>Going  a  step  further,  the  wisdom  path  Gu  cultivator  would  use  all  sorts  of   clues  and  information  to  deduce  certain  possibilities  according  to  the  rules   of  heaven  and  earth  or  the  behavior  of  people,  this  gave  them  control  over   the  future.</p>
<p>This  was  the  essence  of  wisdom  path!</p>
<p>Precisely  because  of  this  essence,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   was  the  only  person  who  became  one  with  the  Dao  among  all  of  the   venerables  in  history.</p>
<p>She  fused  with  heaven’s  will  and  influenced  fate  Gu,  it  turned  fate  into  the   biggest  certainty  in  the  world.</p>
<p>From  this  aspect,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  unique.</p>
<p>All  sorts  of  information  flowed  into  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  mind  like  countless  tributaries  within  the  star  array  calculation   formation.</p>
<p>These  information  included  the  fundamental  structure  of  the  mountains  and   rivers,  weather  changes,  the  arrangements  of  various  Gu  cultivation  forces,   or  even  the  locations  of  Gu  Immortals  and  their  current  conditions.</p>
<p>A  vast  amount  of  information  entered  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  mind  like  a  tidal  wave  that  was  entering  the  boundless  sea.</p>
<p>If  this  was  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  or  Great  Love  Immortal   Venerable,  they  would  not  be  able  to  handle  it.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  different.</p>
<p>She  cultivated  wisdom  path  and  had  a  huge  mind  far  surpassing  the  other   venerables,  she  could  calmly  process  all  this  information  with  ease.</p>
<p>A  faint  feeling  of  joy  appeared  in  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   heart.</p>
<p>Her  control  over  Central  Continent’s  situation  was  rapidly  increasing.</p>
<p>The  more  information  that  a  wisdom  path  Gu  cultivator  had,  the  more   advantage  they  could  unleash  as  a  wisdom  path  cultivator.</p>
<p>Otherwise,  why  would  people  say  that  information  path  and  wisdom  path   were  the  most  compatible?</p>
<p>“With  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  I  can  oversee  Central  Continent   at  all  times,  it  is  like  a  miniature  Heaven  Overseeing  Tower.”</p>
<p>“Central  Continent’s  emotions  are  quite  stable,  while  the  ten  great  ancient   sects  have  higher  morale  than  usual.  It  seems  that  they  have  already  seen   the  situation  in  the  other  four  regions.”</p>
<p>“But  the  current  star  array  calculation  formation  is  still  at  the  most   foundational  stage,  it  has  much  room  for  improvement.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  planned  secretly.</p>
<p>For  example,  in  terms  of  collecting  information,  the  investigative  methods   were  not  outstanding.</p>
<p>Not  to  mention  Gu  Immortals,  even  mortal  Gu  Master  experts  could  keep   their  own  secrets  to  a  certain  extent.</p>
<p>In  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  information  path  Immortal  Gu  that   could  store  information  were  rare  and  needed  to  be  added.  The  best   arrangement  would  be  to  directly  transplant  the  Qian  Kun  Crystal  Wall  into   it.</p>
<p>Or  for  example,  the  star  array  calculation  formation’s  own  deduction,   thinking,  and  deployment  abilities  also  had  room  for  growth.</p>
<p>But  this  needed  a  lot  of  Immortal  Gu  as  well.</p>
<p>Thieving  Heaven  Demon  Venerable  created  electric  brain  Gu,  wisdom  brain   Gu,  light  brain  Gu,  and  others.</p>
<p>Genesis  Lotus  Immortal  Venerable  invented  a  special  type  of  immortal   plant  —  brain  melon.</p>
<p>Reckless  Savage  Demon  Venerable  had  once  owned  monkey  brain  Gu,   dragon  brain  Gu,  phoenix  brain  Gu,  as  well  as  the  brain  muscle  Gu  that   could  be  used  alongside  strength  path  methods.</p>
<p>There  was  also  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  food  path  research  result   —  brain  juice  Gu.</p>
<p>These  Gu  worms  were  all  suitable  for  the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Other  than  these,  the  star  array  calculation  formation’s  own  offensive  and   defensive  capabilities  also  contained  huge  potential  to  get  stronger.</p>
<p>“But  the  current  star  array  calculation  formation  has  already  reached  the   bottom-line  of  the  venerables.  If  I  raise  any  aspect,  they  may  come  to  attack   it.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  understood  the  situation  well.</p>
<p>Because  of  external  pressure  and  the  fact  that  it  needed  many  Immortal  Gu,   the  star  array  calculation  formation  could  only  be  developed  to  this  extent.</p>
<p>“Next,  I  need  to  collate  the  information  of  all  the  Gu  Immortals  in  the   Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects.  Their  lifespan,  cultivation  level,   path,  Immortal  Gu,  killer  moves,  immortal  aperture  situations,  attainment   levels,  and  others,  after  processing  this  information,  I  will  let  the  star  array   calculation  formation  deploy  them  accordingly.”</p>
<p>“As  for  the  Gu  Immortals  of  the  two  heavens’  grotto-heavens…”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  decided  to  slow  down.</p>
<p>This  could  not  be  rushed.</p>
<p>Probing  a  Gu  Immortal’s  information  was  something  that  went  against  the   social  norm.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  forcefully  pushed  through  this  plan,   because  the  ten  great  ancient  sects  were  subsidiaries  of  Heavenly  Court,  it   was  possible.</p>
<p>Even  so,  immortals  of  Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects  did  not   feel  comfortable  about  it,  they  still  concealed  some  information.</p>
<p>But  these  were  minor  issues,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not   want  to  force  them.</p>
<p>By  forcing  them  now,  she  would  only  lose  the  support  of  the  people,  it  was   not  worth  it.</p>
<p>Would  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  act  so  unwise?</p>
<p>After  these  immortals  start  gaining  benefits,  their  mindsets  would  change,   they  would  actively  contribute  to  the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>After  that  happened,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  would  urge  the   Gu  Immortals  of  the  two  heavens’  grotto-heavens  to  contribute  their  own   information  to  the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Now  was  not  the  time.</p>
<p>Many  super  forces  of  the  two  heavens’  grotto-heavens  had  just  joined   Heavenly  Court.  If  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  forced  them,  they   would  become  disheartened,  the  rest  of  the  world  would  also  see  the  sorry   state  that  they  ended  up  in  after  joining  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>For  the  long  term  situation,  it  would  not  benefit  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  first  refined  Heavenly  Court’s  dao   marks,  she  then  interfered  in  Western  Desert  and  interrupted  Fang  Yuan’s   plans,  she  then  created  the  derivation  formation  and  recruited  many  of  the</p>
<p>two  heavens’  grotto-heavens,  after  that,  she  worked  with  Fang  Yuan  to  fight   against  Giant  Sun  while  creating  the  basic  form  of  the  star  array  calculation   formation.</p>
<p>All  sorts  of  measures  and  countermeasures  were  used  in  a  stable  manner.   Now,  Heavenly  Court  was  revitalized,  it  got  over  the  repeated  history  of   failure  and  had  a  bright  future  ahead.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  is  even  more  injured  than  me,  he  has  to   recover  and  refine  rank  nine  light  Gu.”</p>
<p>“As  for  Fang  Yuan,  he  lacks  immortal  essence,  be  it  refining  natural  dao   marks  or  the  contest  between  venerables,  it  will  be  tough  on  him.”</p>
<p>“The  greatest  uncertainty  is  still  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.”</p>
<p>Thinking  of  this,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  looked  afar  again.</p>
<p>In  the  two  heavens,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  bathed  in  flames,   his  mountain-like  body  was  melting  and  regenerating  at  all  times,  his  three   heads  were  twisted  and  growling  in  painful  agony.</p>
<p>“Spectral  Soul…”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  muttered  lightly,   intense  killing  intent  rose  in  her  heart.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  shook  slightly  as  intense  joy  filled  his  heart,  yet,  his  expression   remained  the  same.</p>
<p>Rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu  was  refined!</p>
<p>Ever  since  the  battle  over  light  Gu,  Fang  Yuan’s  refinement  of  heavenly   secret  Gu  passed  the  most  difficult  trial.</p>
<p>After  that,  Fang  Yuan  returned  to  Eastern  Sea  and  did  not  refine  the  natural   dao  marks,  he  pretended  to  be  storing  up  immortal  essence  while  secretly   refining  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Just  earlier,  Fang  Yuan  finally  achieved  success,  rank  nine  heavenly  secret   Gu  was  created!</p>
<p>It  was  really  rare.</p>
<p>This  was  the  first  attempt  at  refining  it  but  he  succeeded.</p>
<p>The  main  reason  was  rank  nine  advance  refinement  Gu,  it  helped  Fang   Yuan  greatly.  Secondly,  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu  had  an  amazing  recipe   that  was  modified  by  Fang  Yuan,  it  had  reached  a  certain  limit  of  perfection.</p>
<p>But  looking  at  the  overall  situation,  the  difficulty  was  still  quite  high.</p>
<p>If  Fang  Yuan  had  not  taken  a  risk  by  staking  his  life,  he  could  have  lost   terribly.</p>
<p>Once  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu  was  refined,  Fang  Yuan  went  on  to   modify  the  killer  move  obscured  heavenly  secret.</p>
<p>This  was  not  difficult.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  very  confident  in  succeeding.</p>
<p>He  had  accumulated  a  lot  of  experience  when  modifying  heavenly  secret   Gu’s  recipe,  while  obscured  heavenly  secret  itself  was  an  amazing  killer   move,  it  had  a  firm  foundation.</p>
<p>“I  need  to  find  a  time  to  meet  with  Li  Xiao  Bai  and  use  rank  nine  obscured   heavenly  secret  on  him.  That  way,  he  will  be  able  to  stay  undercover   safely.”</p>
<p>“Maybe  I  can  make  use  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  to  create  a   chance?”</p>
<p>Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  focusing  on  healing.</p>
<p>Using  the  vast  number  of  Longevity  Heaven’s  luck  path  dao  marks,  he   slowly  refined  the  star  path,  wisdom  path,  and  refinement  path  dao  marks   on  his  body.</p>
<p>Even  though  he  gained  rank  nine  light  Gu,  he  felt  an  even  greater  sense  of   urgency  now.</p>
<p>“Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  devoured  the  wild  rank  nine  fire  Gu,  that   is  an  extremely  stupid  move.”</p>
<p>“He  is  insane  now,  there  is  no  way  he  can  refine  fire  Gu.  To  save  itself,  fire   Gu  will  fight  desperately  inside  his  body,  expending  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable’s  soul  path  dao  marks.”</p>
<p>“Once  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  weakens  to  a  certain  level,  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  will  attack,   an  intense  battle  will  erupt  again.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  use  any  investigative  killer  move.</p>
<p>He  had  to  save  immortal  essence  now.</p>
<p>This  time,  in  order  to  protect  Light  Emperor  and  take  rank  nine  light  Gu,  he   consumed  a  lot  of  immortal  essence  in  fighting  both  venerables  at  once.</p>
<p>If  he  continued  to  fight  against  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  in  the   upcoming  battle,  because  of  his  advantage  with  light  Gu,  the  two  venerables   might  join  up  to  target  him.</p>
<p>The  fact  that  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  rank  nine  light  Gu  was  also   quite  troublesome.</p>
