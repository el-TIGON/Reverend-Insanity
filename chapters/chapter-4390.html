    <p>:  Fang  Yuan  Plunders  Central  Continent!</p>
<p>Profound  jade  snake  cave  was  a  famous  super  resource  point  in  Central   Continent.</p>
<p>It  belonged  to  one  of  the  ten  great  ancient  sects,  Heaven’s  Envy  Manor.  The   scale  of  annual  resource  production  of  profound  jade  snake  cave  was  among   the  top  five  in  Central  Continent,  the  resources  it  produced  were  of  many   types  as  well,  including  enslavement  path,  transformation  path,  earth  path,   dark  path,  space  path,  and  poison  path.</p>
<p>Profound  jade  snake  cave  was  the  breeding  ground  for  countless  poisonous   creatures  among  which  profound  jade  snakes  were  the  overlords  that   countered  poison.  Every  profound  jade  snake  was  an  immemorial  desolate   beast,  they  were  born  from  jade,  had  no  scales,  were  light  green  resembling   jade,  and  emitted  fresh  fragrance.</p>
<p>The  most  valuable  resources  in  profound  jade  snake  cave  were  the  profound   jade  snakes  but  it  was  not  easy  to  find  them.  It  was  not  only  because   profound  jade  snakes  were  small  and  enjoyed  silence,  profound  jade  snake   cave’s  terrain  was  complex  with  thousands  of  caves  in  it.  And  because  it   had  space  path  dao  marks,  small  caves  often  contained  large  spaces  and   were  nested  upon  each  other.</p>
<p>Heaven’s  Envy  Manor  might  possess  this  super  resource  point  and  also  set   up  an  immortal  formation  here  but  had  never  grasped  it  completely.  Every   year,  Heaven’s  Envy  Manor  had  to  send  many  Gu  Immortal  experts  to   explore  profound  jade  snake  cave  to  capture  profound  jade  snakes.</p>
<p>But  for  the  current  Fang  Yuan,  it  was  not  much  of  a  trouble.</p>
<p>“Rise.”  After  preparing  for  a  while,  Fang  Yuan  used  a  killer  move.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  the  earth  and  mountains  shook.</p>
<p>The  whole  profound  jade  snake  cave  rose  slowly  amidst  billowing  smoke,   and  under  Fang  Yuan’s  methods,  shrank  and  was  placed  into  sovereign   immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>This  was  already  the  eleventh  super  resource  point  that  Fang  Yuan  obtained.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  if  you  don’t  hand  over  my  clone,  I   will  take  away  all  of  Central  Continent’s  large  resource  points!”  Fang  Yuan   did  not  forget  to  shout  threats.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  showed  no  movement,  she  had   clearly  resolved  herself  to  stay  in  Heavenly  Court  and  revive  Primordial   Origin  Immortal  Venerable.  She  was  not  going  to  be  shaken  by  the  outside   world.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  snorted  coldly  as  he  continued.</p>
<p>He  arrived  at  the  source  of  Falling  Heavenly  River.</p>
<p>This  river  was  a  boundless  expanse  of  water  that  heavily  crashed  at  the   riverbed  from  an  endless  height.  The  rumbling  noise  of  the  waterfall  was   like  the  continuous  crackling  of  thunder.  Endless  water  vapor  formed  dense   fog  that  shrouded  a  vast  range  of  the  surroundings.</p>
<p>The  reason  for  the  formation  of  this  river  was  because  of  Bo  Qing’s  attempt   to  breakthrough  to  rank  nine.</p>
<p>Falling  Heavenly  River  smashed  open  an  inland  river  that  opened  a  channel   that  flowed  through  the  entirety  of  Central  Continent,  towards  the  eastern   side  of  central  continent,  and  into  eastern  sea.</p>
<p>Even  the  merging  of  two  heavens  only  reduced  the  size  of  Falling  Heavenly   River  slightly,  it  was  still  a  majestic  sight  to  behold.</p>
<p>After  taking  profound  jade  snake  cave,  Fang  Yuan  arrived  at  the  source  of   Falling  Heavenly  River.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  made  his  move.</p>
<p>After  a  while,  Falling  Heavenly  River’s  size  shrank  to  sixty  percent!</p>
<p>This  sixty  percent  Falling  Heavenly  River  was  stored  inside  sovereign   immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>The  water  level  of  the  inland  river  at  the  source  of  Falling  Heavenly  River   fell  by  thousands  of  feet.  The  water  surface  at  the  middle  and  lower  stream   of  Falling  Heavenly  River  began  to  reduce  rapidly  and  exposed  the  river   bed,  causing  negative  influences  on  the  surrounding  plants,  crops,   temperature,  mortal  habitats,  and  so  on.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  left  Falling  Heavenly  River  and  arrived  at  spirit  bank  spring.</p>
<p>This  was  a  super  resource  point  that  belonged  to  Ancient  Soul  Sect,  which   had  once  sent  Yang  Feng  to  guard  this  place  but  was  still  plundered  by   Forgotten  Daoist.</p>
<p>But  now,  Yang  Feng  had  already  followed  Ancient  Soul  Sect  to  enter   Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  easily  dismantled  the  immortal  formation  and  took  spirit  bank   spring  away.</p>
<p>After  spirit  bank  spring  was  pot  river.</p>
<p>This  river  resembled  a  long  jade  belt,  it  was  situated  in  the  eastern  area  of   Central  Continent.  The  riverbank  was  filled  with  willow  trees  and  gentle   breeze.  The  water  in  pot  river  was  smooth  flowing,  like  a  beautiful  song,  it</p>
<p>was  graceful  and  harmonious.  There  was  a  lot  of  pot  grass  growing  in  pot   river.</p>
<p>Wind  Cloud  Manor  was  in  charge  of  pot  river  and  held  a  festival  around  pot   river  every  year.</p>
<p>But  not  long  later,  pot  river  along  with  its  river  channel  was  moved  into  the   immortal  aperture  by  Fang  Yuan.  Even  if  there  were  to  be  pot  river  festivals   in  the  future,  they  could  only  be  held  inside  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture.</p>
<p>After  pot  river  was  Hidden  Dragon  Cave.</p>
<p>Hidden  Dragon  Cave  had  once  imprisoned  the  legendary  immemorial   desolate  beast  Di  Zang  Sheng.  There  were  very  large  numbers  of  scale   enslavement  path  and  rule  path  dao  marks  here.  There  was  also  the   remnants  of  the  huge  immortal  Gu  formation  that  Heavenly  Court  set  up   here,  it  had  a  huge  reference  value  to  most  formation  path  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>After  Hidden  Dragon  Cave  was  put  into  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture,   Fang  Yuan  moved  to  Lake  Heart  Mountain.</p>
<p>This  was  Spirit  Affinity  House’s  headquarters.</p>
<p>It  was  definitely  an  outstanding  place  to  be  chosen  as  the  encampment  of   one  of  the  ten  great  ancient  sects.</p>
<p>Lake  Heart  Mountain  was  a  super  resource  point  by  itself,  not  only  did  it   contain  secret  inheritance  peak,  lesser  cold  peak,  affection  peak,  fierce  fire   peak,  heavenly  flowers  peak,  and  other  peaks,  it  also  had  Fairy  Life  Tablet   Hall,  time  path  cultivation  immortal  formation,  and  other  facilities.</p>
<p>Naturally,  life  tablet  Gu  was  already  taken  from  the  Fairy  Life  Tablet  Hall,   the  time  path  cultivation  immortal  formation’s  Immortal  Gu  were  also  taken   away.  But  these  facilities  were  mostly  intact,  they  could  be  used  after   repairing.</p>
<p>Soon,  Lake  Heart  Mountain  became  a  scenic  spot  within  the  sovereign   immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>After  Lake  Heart  Mountain  was  Mountain  Tortoise  Valley,  then   Imprisonment  Valley,  red  river  beach,  hundred  segment  forest,  scale  light   river,  earth  qi  rock  forest,  Quiet  Rain  Valley…..</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  looted  wantonly,  he  did  not  hold  back  at  all!</p>
<p>Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects  had  left,  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  was  holed  up  in  Heavenly  Court;  Fang  Yuan  had  no   obstructions.</p>
<p>His  looting  efficiency  was  extremely  high!</p>
<p>If  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  relocate  these  resource  points,   he  had  to  use  luck  path  methods  or  blood  path  methods  to  imitate  other   paths  and  put  in  a  lot  of  effort  to  move  them.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  the  sovereign  immortal  body  which  had  non-conflicting  dao   marks,  so  he  could  use  methods  of  all  paths.  Earth  path  was  more  suitable   to  relocate  caves  and  caverns.  Wood  path  methods  were  appropriate  to   plunder  forests.</p>
<p>Another  point  was  that  Fang  Yuan  had  a  lot  of  Immortal  Gu  in  his  reserves.   Putting  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  aside,  refining  rank  eight  Immortal  Gu  was   as  easy  as  drinking  water  to  him.</p>
<p>Resource  points  were  looted  one  after  the  other,  the  essence  of  the  whole   Central  Continent  was  being  plundered  by  him  and  his  appetite  showed  no   signs  of  being  full!</p>
<p>There  were  some  resource  points  which  Fang  Yuan  could  not  obtain   completely  for  the  moment.</p>
<p>For  instance,  Sorrowful  Wind  Mountain  Range.  The  mountain  range  was   extremely  range,  Fang  Yuan  could  not  relocate  the  whole  mountain  range  in</p>
<p>a  short  period.  He  could  easily  take  one  or  two  mountain  peaks  but  the   mountain  range  was  a  long  stretch,  it  could  not  be  compared  to  one  or  two   mountain  peaks.</p>
<p>Another  example  was  Hairy  Foot  Mountain.  Hairy  Foot  Mountain  once   held  Infallible  blessed  land,  Fang  Yuan  had  came  to  this  place  first  but  it   was  already  destroyed  by  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>There  was  also  Reincarnation  Battlefield.  This  was  the  battlefield  killer   move  that  was  personally  set  up  by  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable.  It   was  famous  in  history  and  was  publicly  recognized  as  the  number  one   battlefield  killer  move  since  ancient  times!  Fang  Yuan  had  carefully   observed  it  before  leaving  directly.</p>
<p>It  was  not  that  he  could  not  take  it  but  it  required  careful  study  and   deductions.  This  required  a  lot  of  time  and  effort,  moreover,  the  specific   time  required  was  difficult  to  be  estimated.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  a  lot  of  experience  in  looting  so  his  actions  were  extremely   efficient.</p>
<p>He  left  forty  percent  of  Falling  Heavenly  River,  it  was  not  because  he  was   willing  to  leave  it  behind,  but  he  would  have  to  spend  more  time  and  effort   to  take  it.  And  it  was  better  to  loot  other  places  than  waste  time  here!</p>
<p>Central  Continent  fell  into  an  unprecedented  state  of  unrest.</p>
<p>There  was  no  such  unrest  and  chaos  even  during  the  fate  war.</p>
<p>The  fate  war  was  mainly  the  war  of  Gu  Immortals,  Heavenly  Court  and   Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects  defended  their  positions.</p>
<p>But  now  that  the  Gu  Immortals  of  Heavenly  Court  and  Central  Continent’s   ten  great  ancient  sects  were  all  holed  up  inside  Heavenly  Court,  Central   Continent  became  an  unguarded  place.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  conceal  his  action  of  looting  and  relocating  resource   points.  Every  time  he  moved,  it  would  cause  a  huge  commotion  that  was</p>
<p>noticed  by  others,  and  his  actions  enticed  others  as  well.</p>
<p>“The  grand  venerable  is  eating  meat  but  we  should  be  able  to  drink  the   remaining  soup,  right?”</p>
<p>“Even  if  it  is  just  one  mouthful,  it  is  enough  for  us  to  be  full.”</p>
<p>“This  is  Central  Continent,  the  ten  great  ancient  sects  have  all  moved  away!   This  opportunity  won’t  come  again.”</p>
<p>The  five  regional  walls  were  gone,  so  the  other  four  regions’  Gu  Immortals   began  to  move.  After  them  were  Central  Continent’s  few  demonic  path  Gu   Immortals  and  lone  immortals,  then  finally  were  Central  Continent’s   righteous  path  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Central  Continent’s  righteous  path  did  not  consist  of  just  the  ten  great   ancient  sects,  there  were  many  other  super  forces,  for  instance,  Great   Heavenly  Sword  Sect,  Lightning  Information  Sect,  Demon  Expelling  Sect,   and  so  on.</p>
<p>Naturally,  these  righteous  path  forces  moved  with  the  excuse  of  defending   Central  Continent  and  helping  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>These  people  did  not  dare  to  appear  in  front  of  Fang  Yuan,  but  Central   Continent  was  huge  and  had  a  lot  of  resource  points.  Many  resource  points   could  not  catch  Fang  Yuan’s  eye  or  were  positioned  towards  the  end  of  the   looting  plan,  these  areas  became  the  target  of  the  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>The  sovereign  immortal  aperture  was  also  in  chaos.</p>
<p>Gu  Immortals  were  so  busy  that  their  heads  were  spinning.</p>
<p>There  had  never  been  such  a  moment  when  resource  points  were  moved  in   on  such  a  large  scale.</p>
<p>This  was  simply  like  a  flood  of  resources,  unceasing  and  endless.</p>
<p>The  most  crucial  point  was  that  super  resource  points  could  be  found   everywhere  and  were  the  majority,  even  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s   Gu  Immortals  were  shaken  to  the  core.</p>
<p>“Master  is  mighty!  He  is  looting  the  whole  of  Central  Continent.”</p>
<p>“This  is  a  venerable’s  might,  this  is  our  Lord  Fang  Yuan!”</p>
<p>“Great,  Lord  Qi  Sea  was  captured  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable,  even  if  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  revives,  they  will   only  be  welcomed  by  a  barren  Central  Continent.”</p>
<p>“The  first  wind  vein  ring  is  completed!”</p>
<p>“The  second  light  vein  ring  is  finished.”</p>
<p>“Dark  path  has  also  completed  the  first  ring!”</p>
<p>The  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  time  flow  was  very  different  from  the   five  regions’  outside  world.  All  kinds  of  dao  veins  were  constructed  rapidly,   metal  path,  light  path,  dark  path,  poison  path,  rule  path,  enslavement  path,   transformation  path…</p>
<p>Gu  Immortals  worked  day  and  night,  squeezing  out  all  their  energy  and   constantly  visiting  Liver  Life  Hall.  Now  and  then,  someone  would  reach  the   limits  and  their  liver  would  explode,  but  it  was  not  an  issue,  many  healing   halls  were  constructed  around  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>In  an  instant,  many  of  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  Gu  Immortals   became  like  Yu  Zi,  choosing  to  use  the  salt-water  liver  plan.</p>
<p>As  the  saying  went,  humans  needed  windfalls  to  get  rich,  while  horses   needed  extra  grass  to  grow  healthy.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  costless  looting  made  his  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s   development  achieve  an  unprecedented  and  terrifying  efficiency!</p>
<p>Central  Continent  was  surrounded  by  four  regions  but  was  also  a  region   with  rich  resources,  second  only  to  Eastern  Sea.  Eastern  Sea  had  more</p>
<p>water  path  resources  but  Central  Continent  had  resources  of  all  kinds.</p>
<p>Central  Continent  was  developed  by  Heavenly  Court  for  over  three  million   years,  its  development  had  reached  the  limits,  almost  all  the  immortal  level   resource  points  were  developed  to  some  extent.</p>
<p>These  all  became  Fang  Yuan’s  targets.</p>
<p>Many  dao  veins  were  completed  almost  at  one  go  in  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture.  This  was  a  huge  boost  to  the  stability  of  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture!</p>
<p>Thus,  even  though  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  annexed  so  many   resource  points,  because  of  the  dao  veins,  it  became  much  more  stable   instead.</p>
<p>With  such  a  foundation,  Fang  Yuan  could  begin  absorbing  the  Primordial   Domain  in  treasure  yellow  heaven  and  annexing  blessed  lands  everywhere.</p>
<p>He  had  stored  the  Primordial  Domain  in  treasure  yellow  heaven  all  along.   There  was  no  need  to  lie  low  now  and  he  could  start  absorbing  it.</p>
<p>There  were  many  blessed  lands  everywhere  in  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>For  instance,  Flowing  Silver  blessed  land  that  was  revealed  because  of  the   qi  tides,  Hu  Immortal  blessed  land  that  Fang  Yuan  gave  up  in  the  past,  or   Star  Form  blessed  land,  and  so  on.</p>
