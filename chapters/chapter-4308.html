        <p>:  Human  Path  Breakthrough</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Ten  rank  five  Gu  Masters  carried  intense  excitement  as  they  arrived  at  a   certain  important  location  deep  within  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>They  were  the  ten  children  of  human  path.</p>
<p>“This  is  the  derivation  formation?”  Xiao  Qi  Xing  walked  at  the  front.</p>
<p>Behind  him  were  the  other  nine,  Sun  Yuan  Hua,  Fairy  Bi  Xia,  Gu  Ting,  Wei   Wu  Shang,  Ying  Sheng  Ji,  Chen  Da  Jiang,  Tang  Ru  Qi,  Sun  Yao,  and  Zhao   Shu  Ye.</p>
<p>These  were  the  most  outstanding  Gu  Masters  of  Central  Continent’s  ten   great  ancient  sects,  they  were  nurtured  by  Heavenly  Court  and  cultivated   within  Divine  Emperor  City’s  painting  worlds,  becoming  the  rising  stars  of   human  path.</p>
<p>They  each  carried  a  heavy  burden,  they  were  the  budding  sprouts  of   Heavenly  Court  and  the  venerables’  desire  towards  human  path,  integral  to   the  goal  of  Central  Continent’s  dominance  of  the  world.</p>
<p>The  ten  of  then  looked  ahead  and  saw  a  vast  field  of  grey-white  smoke   presented  before  everyone’s  vision.</p>
<p>The  light  continued  to  transform  continuously,  it  was  slithery  like  a  dragon,   fluttering  beautifully  like  a  butterfly,  standing  on  the  wall,  or  even  tranquil   like  still  water.</p>
<p>“This  derivation  formation  is  arranged  by  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  personally,  it  is  Heavenly  Court’s  greatest  secret!”</p>
<p>“We  are  immensely  fortunate  to  be  the  first  batch  of  Gu  Masters  allowed  to   cultivate  in  this  formation.”</p>
<p>“The  outcome  of  black  heaven  engulfing  white  heaven  is  set,  heaven’s  will   is  going  to  become  stable  again.  Soon,  we  will  be  able  to  advance  to   become  human  path  Gu  Immortals.”</p>
<p>“Thus,  the  derivation  formation  is  our  greatest  fortuitous  encounter  before   becoming  a  Gu  Immortal,  we  need  to  make  use  of  this  unparalleled   opportunity!”</p>
<p>“That’s  right,  after  entering  the  formation  to  cultivate,  the  relevant   memories  will  be  deleted  in  our  minds,  after  that,  who  knows  when  we  can   come  here  again.”</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  discussed  among  themselves  and  arranged   the  order  of  which  they  would  enter.</p>
<p>Sun  Yuan  Hua  was  the  first  to  enter  the  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>After  fifteen  minutes,  he  slowly  stumbled  out  of  the  constantly  changing   light.</p>
<p>“How  was  it,  what  did  you  experience  in  the  formation?”</p>
<p>“Are  there  any  gains?”</p>
<p>“Quick,  tell  us.”</p>
<p>The  other  nine  quickly  went  to  him  and  asked.</p>
<p>Sun  Yuan  Hua  was  still  a  little  dazed  now  but  he  soon  recovered  his  senses.</p>
<p>He  recalled:  ”After  I  went  in,  all  I  saw  was  vast  white  fog.  I  tried  stepping   in  and  vaguely  saw  a  human  figure  so  I  gave  chase.”</p>
<p>“I  chased  it  for  a  long  time,  after  an  unknown  distance,  more  and  more   human  figures  appeared  in  the  white  fog.”</p>
<p>“There  were  five  or  six  of  them  initially,  after  that,  there  were  fifty  or  sixty,   followed  by  six  hundred  or  seven  hundred.  By  the  time  I  reacted,  I  was   already  inside  a  vast  sea  of  humans,  I  was  surrounded  by  people!”</p>
<p>“I  wanted  to  ask  them  questions  but  I  could  not  speak.  I  tried  to  smile  to   communicate  with  them.  But  in  the  end,  I  found  that  they  were  all  smiling   at  me  too.”</p>
<p>“Their  smiles  were  very  fake,  it  looked  like…  a  painting  drawn  using   lines.”</p>
<p>“Can  you  imagine?  Countless  people  showed  a  fake  smile  at  me  as  they   squeezed  around  me,  slowly  getting  closer  and  tighter,  making  me  feel   suffocated.”</p>
<p>“I  tried  my  best  to  push  them  away,  but  my  strength  became  smaller  and   smaller.”</p>
<p>“Eventually,  I  was  engulfed  by  the  sea  of  humans  with  fake  smiles.”</p>
<p>“By  the  time  I  regained  my  senses,  I  had  already  stepped  out  of  the   formation  and  saw  you  guys.”</p>
<p>“At  the  same  time,  in  the  depth  of  my  mind,  I  found  the  Immortal  Gu  recipe   of  shadow  puppet  Gu!”</p>
<p>After  explaining  his  encounter,  Sun  Yuan  Hua  still  showed  some  fear  on  his   face.</p>
<p>His  description  was  very  useful  for  the  others  in  their  preparation.</p>
<p>“Why  does  it  seem  like  a  nightmare?”</p>
<p>“This  formation  is  truly  extraordinary.”</p>
<p>“Looking  at  the  situation,  it  seems  that  after  entering  the  derivation   formation,  we  will  get  a  human  path  Immortal  Gu  recipe?”</p>
<p>“One  attempt  is  not  enough  for  a  conclusion,  who  will  go  next?”</p>
<p>After  the  remaining  nine  discussed  for  a  while  and  came  up  with  no   explanation,  the  second  person  was  decided,  Gu  Ting.</p>
<p>Under  everyone’s  gaze,  Gu  Ting  slowly  walked  into  the  light  fog.</p>
<p>Several  minutes  later,  Gu  Ting  walked  out  of  the  formation  in  a  daze,  it  was   similar  to  Sun  Yuan  Hua’s  situation.</p>
<p>But  soon,  he  recovered.</p>
<p>Everyone  got  around  him  and  listened  to  his  encounter.</p>
<p>Gu  Ting’s  situation  was  quite  different  from  Sun  Yuan  Hua,  he  did  not  see   any  human  figures,  instead,  he  felt  like  he  did  not  even  open  his  eyes.</p>
<p>The  only  thing  he  heard  was  music.</p>
<p>The  music  created  by  some  instrument  constantly  played  in  his  mind.</p>
<p>After  the  tune  ended,  Gu  Ting  walked  out  of  the  immortal  formation.</p>
<p>“I  received  an  Immortal  Gu  recipe,  it  is  the  vital  Gu  that  I  had  recently   swapped  to  —  musician  Gu.”</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  talked  among  themselves  again.</p>
<p>Shadow  puppet  Gu  and  musician  Gu  were  both  human  path  Gu  worms,  they   were  also  Sun  Yuan  Hua’s  and  Gu  Ting’s  vital  Gu.</p>
<p>“That  means  the  reward  has  something  to  do  with  our  vital  Gu?”</p>
<p>“Or  more  accurately,  the  reward  is  our  vital  Gu’s  Immortal  Gu  recipe?  That   is  so  useful  to  us!”</p>
<p>“That’s  right,  we  may  be  able  to  use  the  excess  tribulation  qi  during  our   ascension  to  refine  our  vital  Immortal  Gu!”</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  were  very  excited.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  arranged  for  them  to  cultivate  human  path.</p>
<p>There  was  a  benefit  and  demerit  in  doing  so.</p>
<p>The  benefit  was  that  a  new  path  had  no  counter  in  this  world,  the  more   human  path  developed,  the  greater  its  advantage  against  other  paths.</p>
<p>The  demerit  was  that  a  new  path  was  too  young,  without  the  help  of   predecessors,  the  ten  children  of  human  path  had  to  develop  human  path   step  by  step  on  their  own.</p>
<p>Although  Heavenly  Court  had  the  human  path  killer  moves  made  by  the   past  venerables,  they  were  too  high  ranked  and  of  utmost  secrecy,  the  ten   children  of  human  path  had  no  authority  to  learn  of  them.</p>
<p>They  understood  that  it  would  be  extremely  hard  for  them  to  create  human   path  Immortal  Gu  recipes  on  their  own.  The  time,  effort,  and  resources   needed  were  unthinkable.</p>
<p>Even  if  they  could  use  the  opportunity  of  natural  inspiration  to  ask  heaven’s   will  when  undergoing  tribulation,  they  were  not  guaranteed  an  Immortal  Gu   recipe.</p>
<p>They  were  the  pioneers  of  human  path,  it  was  possible  that  the  world  itself   did  not  have  the  corresponding  human  path  Immortal  Gu  they  needed.</p>
<p>However,  when  the  third  person,  Ying  Sheng  Ji,  left  the  immortal   formation,  he  did  not  obtain  an  Immortal  Gu  recipe.</p>
<p>“I  obtained  the  rank  one  to  five  recipe  of  a  brand  new  human  path  Gu,  it  is   called  pill  refiner.”</p>
<p>Ying  Sheng  Ji’s  vital  Gu  was  doctor  Gu,  but  after  entering  the  formation,  he   actually  obtained  a  new  human  path  Gu  recipe.</p>
<p>Ying  Sheng  Ji  was  a  little  disappointed.</p>
<p>In  his  case,  the  immortal  ascension  was  coming  soon,  without  doctor  Gu’s   Immortal  Gu  recipe,  he  would  not  have  a  human  path  Immortal  Gu  to  use   for  a  very  long  time.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  always  been  keeping  a  close  eye   on  the  ten  children  of  human  path.</p>
<p>“After  Sun  Yuan  Hua  entered  the  formation,  his  comprehension  and   understanding  of  human  path  resonated  with  the  inheritance  of  Heavenly   Court’s  former  shadow  path  Gu  Immortal,  Immortal  Monarch  Gu  Ying.   Thus,  he  obtained  the  Immortal  Gu  recipe  of  shadow  puppet  Gu.”</p>
<p>Immortal  Monarch  Gu  Ying  was  someone  who  appeared  after  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  era.</p>
<p>But  after  inspecting  the  historical  records,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  had  a  deep  impression  of  him.</p>
<p>Immortal  Monarch  Gu  Ying  had  stated  in  his  inheritance  that  although   shadow  path  was  just  a  small  branch  of  dark  path  now,  it  had  more   potential.  In  fact,  shadow  path  was  not  just  a  branch  of  dark  path,  it  was   also  part  of  light  path.  How  could  there  be  shadow  without  light?  Precisely   so,  if  shadow  path  developed  in  the  future,  it  could  potentially  fuse  both   light  path  and  dark  path  to  become  a  huge,  more  powerful  path!</p>
<p>“After  Gu  Ting  entered  the  formation,  he  resonated  with  a  sound  path   inheritance  and  obtained  musician  Immortal  Gu’s  recipe.”</p>
<p>“As  for  Ying  Sheng  Ji,  after  entering  the  formation,  because  there  was  no   resonance  with  any  Gu  Immortal’s  inheritance  which  was  skilled  at  healing,   Ruan  Dan’s  pill  path  was  drawn  to  him  instead  and  created  a  result.”</p>
<p>“Pill  refiner  Gu…”</p>
<p>Different  from  Ying  Sheng  Ji,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  felt   that  his  gains  were  greater  than  the  rest.</p>
<p>Human  path  was  the  path  that  Heavenly  Court  was  trying  to  develop,  while   pill  path  was  also  a  new  path.</p>
<p>The  result  of  the  clash  between  these  two  paths  was  pill  refiner  Gu.</p>
<p>It  was  the  fusion  of  Ying  Sheng  Ji’s  human  path  research  result  and  the   essence  of  pill  path,  this  was  a  new  accomplishment.</p>
<p>“The  Gu  recipe  of  pill  refiner  Gu  consists  of  rank  one  to  five,  after  refining   them,  we  can  produce  a  large  number  of  pill  refiners.  These  pill  refiners  are   most  skilled  at  refining  pill  Gu.”</p>
<p>Most  pill  Gu  were  consumable  Gu,  from  the  ones  that  Ruan  Dan  created,   one  could  see  that  they  were  very  effective  and  powerful.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  acutely  sensed  that  if  pill  refiner  Gu   was  spread  widely,  it  could  change  the  current  situation  of  the  Gu  Master   world,  there  would  be  a  huge  revolution!</p>
<p>After  Sun  Yuan  Hua,  Gu  Ting,  and  Ying  Sheng  Ji,  it  was  Xiao  Qi  Xing’s   turn.</p>
<p>This  person  was  seemingly  the  leader  of  the  ten  children  of  human  path,   after  getting  out  of  the  derivation  formation,  he  obtained  the  Immortal  Gu   recipes  of  soldier  Gu  and  sergeant  Gu.</p>
<p>Regrettably,  his  vital  Gu  was  commander  Gu.</p>
<p>Chen  Da  Jiang  was  the  fifth  to  enter.</p>
<p>His  vital  Gu  was  constable  Gu,  but  he  had  not  gotten  its  Immortal  Gu   recipe.</p>
<p>“I  obtained  the  recipe  of  police  gate  Gu,  from  rank  one  to  six.  They  are  one   police  gate  Gu,  two  police  gate  Gu,  and  all  the  way  to  six  police  gate  Gu.”</p>
<p>“The  police  gate  Gu  are  mutually  connected,  after  they  are  refined,  my   constable  Gu  can  create  constables  that  are  able  to  travel  from  one  gate  to   another  gate  instantly.”</p>
<p>After  Chen  Da  Jiang,  Zhao  Shu  Ye  went  in.</p>
<p>Her  vital  Gu  was  craftsman  Gu.</p>
<p>After  entering  the  formation,  she  resonated  with  a  certain  metal  path   inheritance  and  obtained  the  rank  six  Immortal  Gu  recipe  of  blacksmith  Gu.</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  entered  the  derivation  formation  one  by   one,  they  all  had  great  gains,  but  these  gains  were  all  different  as  well.</p>
<p>“No  matter  what,  this  derivation  formation  is  too  amazing!”</p>
<p>“In  just  half  a  day,  all  thanks  to  it,  the  entire  world  had  a  huge  breakthrough   in  human  path’s  development.”</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  is  truly  the  number  one  wisdom   path  expert  throughout  history.”</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  were  extremely  amazed,  their  eyes  were   shining  brightly.</p>
<p>They  wanted  to  enter  the  formation  again  but  were  rejected.</p>
<p>It  was  not  that  the  derivation  formation  could  not,  but  they  themselves  had   reached  a  limit.</p>
<p>The  essence  of  the  derivation  formation  was  to  use  the  research  results  of   the  ten  children  of  human  path  to  clash  with  the  inheritance  of  past  Gu</p>
<p>Immortal  experts,  to  attempt  deriving  new  human  path  research  results  that   had  never  been  possible  before.</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  had  only  cultivated  for  a  short  time,  they   were  all  rank  five  Gu  Masters,  their  foundation  was  limited.</p>
<p>All  of  their  current  potential  had  been  used  up  already,  even  if  they  went  in   again,  their  minds  would  only  be  corrupted  by  the  inheritances,  preventing   them  from  innovating  and  creating  new  ideas,  restricting  their  future   development.</p>
<p>They  were  like  young  sprouts  now,  after  this  injection  of  essence,  they   would  need  to  recuperate  for  a  long  time.  Otherwise,  excessive  help  would   ruin  their  creativity  in  innovating  for  human  path,  their  bright  futures  would   become  dim  and  hopeless,  with  no  expectations  left  for  them.</p>
