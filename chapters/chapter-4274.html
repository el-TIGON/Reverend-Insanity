        <p>: Little Du's Revival</p>
<p>Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p>
<p>Eastern Sea.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan lightly let out a breath of air.</p>
<p>"This time, I succeeded in deceiving her again."</p>
<p>Just earlier, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable used her investigative killer move to check on Fang Yuan.</p>
<p>Obscured heavenly secret activated again and helped him to conceal the truth.</p>
<p>Heaven path…</p>
<p>So be it if Giant Sun Immortal Venerable did not understand heaven path. But even Star Constellation Immortal Venerable was deceived time and again, she had once become one with the Dao, she was able to influence and alter heaven's will.</p>
<p>"Even she was deceived by me, is it because of heaven path's profundity, or because her revival had flaws in it, in terms of heaven path, she did not regain her former life's abilities?"</p>
<p>"Earlier, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable's investigative method had unprecedented power. It is very likely that she has already refined all of Heavenly Court's wisdom path dao marks."</p>
<p>Fang Yuan was only making a guess, he did not use any investigative method now.</p>
<p>Looking into the sovereign immortal aperture.</p>
<p>Three earth path dao veins had been constructed already.</p>
<p>A wind path dao vein and a fire path dao vein were also almost completed too, he was just a few more away from completing the first dao vein ring.</p>
<p>He had undergone countless Immortal Gu transactions in treasure yellow heaven to exchange for resource points. There was also Fang clan's contribution that led to such huge progress.</p>
<p>Western Desert's fire path, earth path, and wind path dao marks were outstanding, these three paths had the most resource points there.</p>
<p>Fang clan was forced into desperation, they had to cut their foundation to fight for survival.</p>
<p>The sovereign immortal aperture gained a lot, but even then, the entire immortal aperture was still in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>Currently, Fang Yuan had already reduced the purchasing of earth path resource points, he started to buy other paths' resource points.</p>
<p>According to his deductions, he had to establish the various paths' dao veins first and construct the first ring. After that, there would be an immediate effect on the sovereign immortal aperture's stability.</p>
<p>"The sovereign immortal aperture is unstable and strange situations are occurring frequently. The Gu Immortals within the immortal aperture are already working at their limit. Even the six mermaid immortals that came into the immortal aperture are not enough anymore."</p>
<p>During this period of time, many Gu Immortals had liver explosions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Fang Yuan constructed a healing hall, otherwise, if these Gu Immortals had to recuperate for a long time, the sovereign immortal aperture would fall apart instantly. In the end, Fang Yuan would need to take action himself to suppress the turmoil.</p>
<p>"I need to bring in more manpower."</p>
<p>Venerables were undoubtedly invincible, but with the contest of three venerables, the situation became rather complex.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, the main priority of the three venerables was to refine natural dao marks.</p>
<p>But the world itself had a vast number of natural dao marks, it would take a long time for the three venerables to refine them all.</p>
<p>Currently, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable was making the fastest progress, but he was still refining Northern Plains' dao marks.</p>
<p>The three venerables were not at the stage of having a decisive battle yet.</p>
<p>Because Longevity Heaven and Heavenly Court were refined, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had their own firm base. Even if the other venerables collaborated, they could not overwhelm the target at their base camp.</p>
<p>And without sufficient advantage, it was unwise to have a battle now.</p>
<p>The venerables would not do that.</p>
<p>Thus, for the following period of time, the venerables would need other Gu Immortals to help them and work for them.</p>
<p>In this situation, normal Gu Immortals were very useful to the venerables.</p>
<p>This value displayed its worth during their deadlock.</p>
<p>Even if Fang Yuan was a refinement path venerable, being capable of easily refining most rank eight and below Immortal Gu and also creating countless Immortal Gu Houses, this could not replace the use of Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>The earlier discussion on Fang clan showed this clearly.</p>
<p>What decided the outcome were not the Immortal Gu Houses but Fang Gong and Wan Gu Chou.</p>
<p>For Gu Immortal experts, once the mechanics of the Immortal Gu House were deciphered, they would be easy to target and deal with.</p>
<p>Be it Fang clan's roof tile breaker or Zuo Qiu clan's state of disunity, they were counters to Immortal Gu Houses.</p>
<p>Thus, the people were most important.</p>
<p>Gu are the essence of heaven and earth, man is the spirit of all living beings.</p>
<p>Having more Immortal Gu was a good thing, but the human element was on par with the Gu.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan needed a large number of Gu Immortal subordinates.</p>
<p>One one hand, in a deadlock of venerables, he needed enough henchman, it would lead to greater convenience.</p>
<p>Especially when he was refining natural dao marks and could not leave.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Fang Yuan's sovereign immortal aperture often needed a large number of Gu Immortals to suppress the strange phenomena that occurred frequently.</p>
<p>Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable also needed Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>On one hand, when the venerables were in a deadlock, they could settle matters for them. For example, when Star Constellation Immortal Venerable refined Heavenly Court's dao marks, Jun Shen Guang went to the two heavens to collect stars.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Longevity Heaven and Heavenly Court were also trying to nurture their second venerable.</p>
<p>After the destruction of fate, it was possible to create new venerables. As for Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, because of their conflicting dao marks, they could not become the venerable of a second path themselves.</p>
<p>But how could they recruit Gu Immortals?</p>
<p>The most convenient source were the Gu Immortals of the five regions.</p>
<p>But this contained huge hidden threats.</p>
<p>On one hand, these Gu Immortals could be the spies of another venerable, the fact that Fang Yuan brought in six mermaid immortals was already a huge risk in itself.</p>
<p>If he had to bring in Gu Immortals of the five regions, Fang Yuan was more inclined to bring in variant humans.</p>
<p>After all, variant humans were on the opposite side of Heavenly Court and Longevity Heaven.</p>
<p>Other than bringing in more Gu Immortals, Fang Yuan's other main method was immortal ascension.</p>
<p>He could nurture Gu Immortals inside the sovereign immortal aperture.</p>
<p>But this had a merit and demerit.</p>
<p>The merit was that the Gu Immortal's loyalty was assured.</p>
<p>The demerit was that the time needed to nurture Gu Immortals was very long. And as the saying went, water in the distance could not quench thirst.</p>
<p>But Fang Yuan had an advantage over the other venerables, his sovereign immortal aperture did not conflict with time path, so changing the time flow was very easy. Right now, the sovereign immortal aperture definitely had the fastest time flow among the venerables.</p>
<p>In terms of nurturing Gu Immortals, Fang Yuan already had many good choices.</p>
<p>He had specially revived some of the Gu Immortals that died in Crazed Demon Cave as mortals.</p>
<p>But now that the two heavens were fusing, heaven's will was chaotic and Gu Immortals were unable to get natural inspiration when they first ascend at this time.</p>
<p>This would not do!</p>
<p>Fang Yuan knew his own limitations. His wisdom path deductions could not match Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, they were barely on par with Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.</p>
<p>Thus, Fang Yuan had to make full use of natural inspiration.</p>
<p>If he missed these opportunities, his killer move deduction and modification would be far slower than the other two venerables.</p>
<p>If he could not bring in Gu Immortals or nurture them himself, what could he do?</p>
<p>Fang Yuan quickly thought of human path.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan's clone was still trapped in Divine Emperor City, but through Shen Shang, he transferred his human path cultivation results to Fang Yuan's main body.</p>
<p>Together with Fang Yuan's transaction with Shen Shang, he also gained a portion of the latter's human path cultivation results.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan obtained the incomplete Immortal Gu recipes of beggar Gu and merchant Gu.</p>
<p>If he had the complete Immortal Gu recipes, Fang Yuan would be able to refine merchant Immortal Gu and beggar Immortal Gu. After activating</p>
<p>them, he would gain manpower, there would be no threat of betrayal as well.</p>
<p>But Fang Yuan lacked human path attainment level, while human path Immortal Gu recipes were hard to deduce.</p>
<p>Were there natural human path Immortal Gu in the wild?</p>
<p>According to Fang Yuan's estimation, the answer was no.</p>
<p>Such Immortal Gu recipes needed to be created by humans!</p>
<p>After deep consideration, Fang Yuan did not attempt to deduce the human path Immortal Gu recipes, they would waste too much of his time and effort.</p>
<p>Thus, Fang Yuan held anticipation towards Central Continent's human path development as well.</p>
<p>Ignoring other matters, just his soul path cultivation needed the support of human path.</p>
<p>Looking at refinement path, it was able to grow to such a prosperous state today because of refinement path's own development and also because it supported all other paths in their development.</p>
<p>Human Sea rippled as huge waves appeared.</p>
<p>After the rise and fall of tides, two fallen Gu Immortals remained on the beach.</p>
<p>"Where, where is this place?"</p>
<p>"I clearly died on the battlefield already…"</p>
<p>Fang Dong Xi and Fang An Lei were confused as they stood up.</p>
<p>This situation made them puzzled and shocked.</p>
<p>But soon, Fang Yuan's will descended and informed them of the situation.</p>
<p>"Lord Fang Yuan actually has such a shocking method to revive us!" Fang clan's two Gu Immortals were filled with joy and excitement upon revival.</p>
<p>Right at this time, there was a giant wave in Human Sea.</p>
<p>The size of this wave was far bigger than the one carrying the Fang clan members.</p>
<p>As the huge wave crashed onto the beach, it receded rapidly.</p>
<p>A young looking Gu Immortal rode the waves and landed ashore.</p>
<p>He gave off rank eight aura, stunning the two Fang clan Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>They immediately recognized that this newly revived Gu Immortal was one of Fang Yuan's main clones — Zhan Bu Du!</p>
<p>When bringing in Gu Immortals, nurturing Gu Immortals, and human path Immortal Gu were all unfeasible at this moment, Fang Yuan chose to revive Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>Originally, the Gu Immortals only revived as mortals.</p>
<p>But now, they kept their cultivation level.</p>
<p>Fang clan's two immortals were rank seven while Zhan Bu Du was rank eight.</p>
<p>To achieve this, Human Sea expended itself at an unprecedented level, it could only revive three more rank eight Gu Immortals at this rate.</p>
<p>Where there are gains, there are losses.</p>
<p>Following this, Fang Yuan would need to collect more human qi to replenish Human Sea.</p>
<p>But there was no rush in this.</p>
<p>The thing that needed replenishment the most was Refinement Sea.</p>
<p>At this point, Fang Yuan's Refinement Sea was almost dry already.</p>
<p>After the two Fang clan Gu Immortals left, Fang Yuan gave all the transformation path Immortal Gu to Zhan Bu Du. This way, as long as he used the transformation path killer move, Zhan Bu Du would gain pseudo venerable battle strength again.</p>
<p>Zhan Bu Du went to handle the strange phenomena while Fang Yuan's main body expended heaven path immortal materials to replenish obscured heavenly secret.</p>
<p>After that, he secretly unsealed the truthful floating ice.</p>
<p>Right now, Fang Yuan's transformation path and rule path attainment levels rose.</p>
<p>But the greatest growth was still heaven path.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan could sense that his heaven path attainment level was reaching a point of qualitative change.</p>
<p>Black and white heaven.</p>
<p>A huge transparent pillar slammed down and killed most of the soul beasts under it.</p>
<p>From the body of a desolate level soul beast, two Gu Immortals flew out.</p>
<p>One was a female immortal who had a graceful figure with hair that extended to her waist, she was adorned in a beautiful purple robe. Her eyes were like deep pools, with a sense of sorrow shrouding her face.</p>
<p>The other was a male immortal, he had an ordinary face, his eyes were dark and he emitted a soul path aura.</p>
<p>They were Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie.</p>
<p>"What heaven path immortal material is this? When it fell, the soul beasts could not move or dodge it at all." Ying Wu Xie asked curiously.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei inspected it and explained: "This is a heavenly pillar. Each heavenly pillar is a rank nine heaven path immortal material! Back then, Central Continent's Tian Ti Mountain could connect to Heavenly Court because it had a heavenly pillar."</p>
<p>"We lost the concealment of soul beasts but gained a rank nine immortal material. Is this good or bad luck?" Ying Wu Xie sighed.</p>
<p>"What's the point of sighing now, the urgent matter is to find Master Spectral Soul, your main body!"</p>
