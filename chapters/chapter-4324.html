    <p>:  Obtaining  Wisdom  Gu  Again</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>At  the  depths  of  the  sea,  in  complete  darkness.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  main  body  concealed  his  movements  as  he  secretly  arrived   here.</p>
<p>A  huge  translucent  bubble  could  be  seen  in  front  of  him.</p>
<p>“This  should  be  the  place.”  Fang  Yuan  realized,  he  stopped  moving,  closely   inspecting  it.</p>
<p>This  bubble  was  formed  in  a  special  manner,  it  was  a  secret  underwater   world  created  from  many  elements,  like  an  underwater  volcano’s  eruption,   the  surrounding  sea  water,  and  the  qi  tides  that  swept  past  previously.</p>
<p>Fire  path,  earth  path,  water  path,  and  qi  path,  the  dao  marks  of  these  four   paths  created  this  isolated  utopia.</p>
<p>This  place  was  very  well  hidden,  unless  any  Gu  Immortal  saw  it  personally,   it  would  be  hard  to  detect.</p>
<p>“I’ll  name  this  the  four  paths  air  bubble.”  Fang  Yuan  activated  his   investigative  method  and  observed  the  surroundings,  before  opening  his   immortal  aperture’s  entrance  to  let  out  a  Gu  Immortal.</p>
<p>This  Gu  Immortal  had  pink  wavy  hair,  he  was  Fang  Yuan’s  dream  path   clone,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  cultivation  level  was  still  low,  but  he  was  a  dream  path   cultivator.</p>
<p>Because  the  mission  was  quite  special,  Fang  Yuan  purposely  dispatched   him.  Otherwise,  he  would  stay  inside  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  most   of  the  time  to  research  dream  path,  on  rare  occasions,  he  went  on  missions   to  stabilize  and  resolve  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  issues.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  used  a  method  to  carefully  move  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  into  the  air   bubble.</p>
<p>After  fifteen  minutes,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  returned  to  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture.</p>
<p>He  succeeded.</p>
<p>He  brought  back  a  wild  wisdom  Gu!</p>
<p>Wisdom  Gu  was  previously  rank  nine,  but  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   made  arrangements  and  gave  it  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>During  the  fate  war,  in  order  to  complete  Red  Lotus’  plan,  wisdom  Gu  was   used  as  one  of  the  materials.</p>
<p>As  a  result,  rank  nine  wisdom  Gu  ceased  to  exist.</p>
<p>But  under  the  laws  of  the  Heavenly  Dao,  life  and  death  coexisted.  Under  the   control  of  heaven’s  will,  a  wild  rank  six  wisdom  Gu  soon  appeared  in  the   five  regions.</p>
<p>This  wisdom  Gu  was  hidden  within  the  air  bubble.</p>
<p>After  Fang  Yuan  stole  heavenly  secrets,  he  found  the  location  of  many  wild   Immortal  Gu,  among  them,  wisdom  Gu  was  his  greatest  gain.</p>
<p>Thus,  he  came  here  personally  to  prevent  any  accidents  from  happening,   ensuring  that  wisdom  Gu  would  be  retrieved  successfully.</p>
<p>Everything  had  happened  according  to  the  information  in  stealing  heavenly   secret.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  used  his  dream  path  method  to  easily  suppress  the  rank  six   wisdom  Gu.</p>
<p>Within  the  air  bubble,  although  there  was  an  underwater  volcano  and   surrounding  fish  groups,  none  were  able  to  threaten  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>As  for  Fang  Yuan,  he  had  too  many  dao  marks,  if  he  stretched  his  hand  into   the  air  bubble,  it  would  likely  burst.</p>
<p>Thus,  only  his  clone  could  accomplish  this.</p>
<p>Rank  six  wisdom  Gu  was  soon  refined  by  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Although  it  was  wisdom  Gu,  Fang  Yuan  was  a  great  refinement  path   venerable,  refining  a  mere  rank  six  Immortal  Gu  was  simply  too  easy.</p>
<p>For  a  venerable,  using  rank  nine  essence  to  refine  wild  rank  eight  Immortal   Gu  posed  no  problems  at  all.</p>
<p>The  difficult  thing  was  refining  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  took  over  a  hundred  years  to  refine   rank  nine  wisdom  Gu  in  her  previous  life,  while  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  failed  to  refine  love  Immortal  Gu,  these  were  all  examples.</p>
<p>“After  the  fate  war,  wisdom  Gu  has  returned  to  my  possession  again.  And   this  time,  it  is  not  tampered  with  by  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.”</p>
<p>“This  is  a  wisdom  Gu  that  belongs  solely  to  me!”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  felt  a  faint  feeling  of  joy  internally.</p>
<p>As  for  raising  wisdom  Gu  back  to  rank  nine?</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  felt  that  there  was  no  urgency  in  this.</p>
<p>With  stealing  heavenly  secret  killer  move,  Fang  Yuan  could  greatly  improve   his  wisdom  path  deductions  and  modifications,  he  could  also  make  up  for   his  lack  of  information  collecting  methods.</p>
<p>After  obtaining  wisdom  Gu,  Fang  Yuan  returned  to  his  original  spot  and   showed  that  he  was  openly  refining  Eastern  Sea’s  refinement  path  dao   marks.  Furthermore,  he  took  breaks  quite  often  to  show  that  his  immortal   essence  was  lacking,  and  that  he  was  in  a  poor  condition.</p>
<p>His  divine  sense  entered  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>During  this  period  of  time,  another  major  project  in  immortal  aperture  was   completed!</p>
<p>For  this  project,  Fang  Yuan  used  all  the  immortal  material  reserves  of  his   subordinates,  among  which,  Eastern  Sea’s  Hua  clan  had  the  greatest   contribution,  they  earned  a  lot  of  contribution  points.</p>
<p>As  for  the  construction  of  the  splendid  cloud  cover,  Fang  Yuan  succeeded   after  he  chose  to  use  stealing  heavenly  secret  to  get  an  answer  from   heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>This  splendid  cloud  cover  covered  a  radius  of  over  ten  li,  it  flew  slowly  in   the  mini  nine  heavens.</p>
<p>Once  in  a  while,  it  would  go  from  one  heaven  to  another.</p>
<p>The  splendid  cloud  was  an  immortal  material  from  rank  six  to  nine.</p>
<p>The  splendid  cloud  that  Fang  Yuan  had  now  was  a  congregation  of  many   different  similar  materials,  most  were  rank  six,  thirty  percent  were  rank   seven,  less  than  ten  percent  was  rank  eight,  while  there  was  barely  any  rank   nine  ones.</p>
<p>The  food  of  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu  was  a  large  field  of   splendid  clouds.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  still  far  from  meeting  the  requirements  of  one  feeding   session.</p>
<p>But  it  was  not  a  concern.</p>
<p>The  higher  tha  Immortal  Gu’s  rank,  the  less  frequent  it  needed  to  be  fed.   Looking  at  the  current  situation,  there  was  still  a  lot  of  time  until  the  next   feeding  session.</p>
<p>During  this  period  of  time,  the  splendid  cloud  cover  could  grow  sufficiently.</p>
<p>There  was  ample  time.</p>
<p>Gu  cultivation  involved  nurture,  use,  and  refinement.  The  feeding  of  rank   nine  Immortal  Gu  was  a  test  that  Fang  Yuan  had  to  pass.</p>
<p>He  currently  had  three  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,  they  were  Heavenly  Essence   Treasure  Imperial  Lotus,  advance  refinement  Immortal  Gu,  and  heavenly   secret  Immortal  Gu.  The  former  two  were  easier  to  feed,  while  heavenly   secret  Immortal  Gu  was  comparatively  more  troublesome.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  planned  in  advance,  he  had  already  started  to  resolve  this   problem.</p>
<p>In  any  case,  the  feeding  of  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  was  not  Fang  Yuan’s   biggest  problem.</p>
<p>He  could  settle  it  by  just  putting  in  some  hard  work.</p>
<p>He  was  already  a  venerable  who  owned  Eastern  Sea  of  the  five  regions,  he   also  has  super  forces  from  the  two  heavens.  Also,  after  his  Great  Love   declaration,  the  most  common  business  in  treasure  yellow  heaven  became   his  Immortal  Gu  refinement  transactions.</p>
<p>And  because  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  had  immense  foundation,   even  in  the  entire  world,  only  Longevity  Heaven  and  Heavenly  Court  could   match  or  beat  him.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  already  seen  the  blue  dragon  whale’s  grotto-heaven   immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Treasure  yellow  heaven  was  a  special  grotto-heaven  meant  for  Gu  Immortal   transactions,  its  own  foundation  could  not  compare  to  the  sovereign   immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>After  this  period  of  development,  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  was   gradually  undergoing  a  qualitative  change.</p>
<p>In  the  past,  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  was  like  a  dying  patient,  it  was   always  close  to  destruction  or  breaking  down  entirely.</p>
<p>But  now,  the  situation  did  not  just  stabilize,  it  was  even  improving.</p>
<p>There  were  two  main  reasons.</p>
<p>One  was  that  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  dao  veins  had  already  been   established  to  a  certain  level,  allowing  it  to  reap  the  first  wave  of  benefits.</p>
<p>There  was  already  one  ring  of  fire  path,  wind  path,  and  water  path  dao   veins.</p>
<p>The  earth  path  dao  vein  that  was  established  first  already  had  three  rings.</p>
<p>This  had  an  immense  effect  to  stabilize  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture,  the   effect  was  immediate.</p>
<p>The  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  Gu  Immortals  could  sense  clearly  that   abnormal  situations  of  earth  path,  fire  path,  wind  path,  and  water  path  were   decreasing  rapidly,  they  became  less  common.</p>
<p>The  second  reason  was  that  more  than  thirty  of  Fang  Yuan’s  Gu  cultivator   subordinates  had  passed  their  immortal  ascension  tribulation!</p>
<p>Immediately,  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  gained  a  huge  supply  of   manpower!</p>
<p>With  abundant  people,  Fang  Yuan  could  easily  dispatch  Gu  Immortals  to   various  locations  in  the  five  regions  secretly  to  collect  the  wild  Immortal   Gu.</p>
<p>Days  later,  Gu  Immortals  started  to  return.  Some  of  them  brought  back   undiscovered  resource  points  while  others  brought  back  wild  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Among  which,  there  was  one  wild  time  path  Immortal  Gu  —  Month.</p>
<p>At  this  point,  he  had  collected  all  three  Immortal  Gu,  Year,  Month,  Day.</p>
<p>After  getting  the  newest  information,  Fang  Yuan’s  subordinates  took  action   with  a  high  success  rate.</p>
<p>The  results  of  stealing  heavenly  secret  did  not  end  here.</p>
<p>While  Fang  Yuan  refined  dao  marks,  he  also  unsealed  the  truthful  floating   ice  secretly  while  making  modifications  to  various  killer  moves.</p>
<p>After  stealing  heavenly  secrets,  He  obtained  a  large  number  of  reference   materials,  his  modification  of  killer  moves  became  very  aggressive,  among   which  were  compound  killer  moves.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  even  started  to  construct  his  combat  system  on  a  large  scale.</p>
<p>All  along,  he  did  not  have  much  gains  in  this  aspect,  but  with  stealing   heavenly  secret,  he  obtained  a  lot  of  information  that  had  immense  value.</p>
<p>Next,  as  Gu  Immortals  continued  to  return,  although  many  succeeded,  some   returned  empty-handed.</p>
<p>Most  of  the  secretive  resource  points  were  brought  back,  but  some  were   damaged  or  destroyed  by  natural  disasters  like  earthquakes  or  tsunamis,   there  was  no  point  in  relocating  them.</p>
<p>As  for  wild  Immortal  Gu,  they  were  also  starting  to  move  elsewhere!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  not  surprised.</p>
<p>Heaven’s  will  could  influence  people’s  minds,  it  could  also  think.  Fang   Yuan  had  always  been  the  target  of  heaven’s  will,  now  that  he  collected  all   these  secretive  resource  points  and  wild  Immortal  Gu,  how  could  heaven’s   will  not  make  a  response?</p>
<p>Heavenly  Dao  emphasized  balance,  it  would  naturally  try  to  restrict  Fang   Yuan  from  getting  even  stronger.</p>
<p>Thus,  this  reaction  was  within  Fang  Yuan’s  expectations.</p>
<p>Thus,  Fang  Yuan  arranged  for  the  most  important  Immortal  Gu  and   resource  points  to  be  the  ones  that  were  targeted  first,  allowing  him  to  have   great  gains.</p>
<p>As  for  the  rest,  they  had  lower  value.  In  comparison,  Fang  Yuan  could  give   up  on  them  with  no  significant  losses,  but  he  could  also  try  and  see  if  any   were  salvageable.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  gradually  digested  his  gains  from  using  stealing  heavenly  secret,   in  this  process,  he  gained  a  deeper  understanding  of  this  killer  move.</p>
<p>“The  information  from  stealing  heavenly  secret  is  extremely  terrifying,  it   completely  made  up  for  my  weakness  in  information  path.  However,  if  I  use   these  information  excessively,  heaven’s  will  will  make  adjustments  and   cause  them  to  become  less  valuable.  Additionally,  grotto-heavens  like   Longevity  Heaven  cannot  be  inspected  through  stealing  heavenly  secret.”</p>
<p>“The  various  killer  moves  and  information  about  combat  system  that  I  steal   are  very  useful  if  I  want  to  modify  killer  moves  and  make  my  own  combat   system.  But  since  heaven’s  will  knows  about  it,  then  this  information  must   have  already  existed  somewhere,  others  might  know  it  too.  Furthermore,   there  are  many  things  that  heaven’s  will  does  not  know,  like  the  secret   venerable  true  inheritances.”</p>
<p>“Heaven’s  will  can  remember  but  not  modify  killer  moves  on  its  own.  The   painting  path,  human  path,  and  pill  path  research  results  that  I  obtained   were  all  produced  through  the  derivation  formation.”</p>
<p>Stealing  heavenly  secret  could  inspect  and  save  Fang  Yuan  a  lot  of  time  and   effort,  it  had  an  amazing  effect.  Regardless,  it  had  its  flaws.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  still  had  a  need  for  information  path  and  wisdom  path   development.</p>
<p>It  was  just  that  his  needs  were  half  satisfied  now,  he  was  no  longer  as  urgent   as  before.</p>
<p>Stealing  heavenly  secret  mainly  relied  on  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu,   once  heaven’s  will  found  out  about  the  Immortal  Gu  recipe,  it  would   respond  and  cause  the  effect  of  stealing  heavenly  secret  to  become  weaker.</p>
<p>Stealing  heavenly  secret  was  also  dependent  on  natural  inspiration,  it  could   not  be  used  freely.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  already  decided  to  nurture  Gu  cultivators  in  the  immortal   aperture,  he  would  continue  to  accumulate  more  Gu  Immortal  seeds.   Whenever  it  was  necessary,  he  would  make  a  bunch  of  time  undergo   immortal  ascension.</p>
