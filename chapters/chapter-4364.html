    <h1>Chapter  2312</h1>
    <p>:  Profundity  of  the  Heaven  Path  Dream  Realm</p>
<p>Waves  continued  to  strike  the  rocky  land,  flooding  and  breaking  the  land   including  the  earth  spikes.</p>
<p>Earth  trenches  were  already  submerged  in  water,  the  underwater  force   continued  to  surge  and  slam  into  the  trenches,  enlarging  them.</p>
<p>Faint  rumbling  sounds  resounded  in  the  blessed  land,  the  rocky  land  started   to  break  apart  due  to  the  continuous  flood.</p>
<p>The  separated  rocky  land  turned  into  five  large  islands  and  tens  of  smaller   islands.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  finally  relaxed  after  finishing  this  step,  a  sense  of   accomplishment  rose  in  his  heart.</p>
<p>It  was  not  easy  to  reach  this  stage.</p>
<p>At  first,  this  blessed  land  had  the  highest  number  of  earth  path  dao  marks,   the  dao  marks  of  other  paths  were  very  few,  the  difference  between  the  two   was  large  which  led  the  terrain  to  become  rocky.</p>
<p>The  rocky  land’s  advantages  and  disadvantages  were  obvious.  It  could   produce  rock  materials  and  ore  mines  which  were  very  beneficial  to  the   rockmen’s  habitat,  but  it  was  not  beneficial  for  the  growth  of  vegetation.</p>
<p>The  blessed  land’s  terrain  was  not  a  bad  thing  originally.</p>
<p>However,  when  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  probed  the  next  three  earthly  calamities;   the  first  calamity  was  the  strength  path  beast  calamity  four-armed  ferocious   ape;  the  second  calamity  was  a  fire  path  calamity  fire  rain,  and  the  third  was   a  transformation  path  calamity  flies  tribulation.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  understood  that  this  dream  path  blessed  land’s  calamities   and  tribulations  were  not  based  on  earth  path.  Developing  in  earth  path  did   not  have  much  prospects.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  immediately  decided  to  remodel  the  terrain!</p>
<p>After  a  Gu  Master  undergoes  immortal  ascension,  very  few  who  would   change  the  terrain  of  their  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>This  step  was  not  easy.</p>
<p>Fortunately,  this  was  a  dream  realm  and  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  had  a  land  spirit’s   powers.</p>
<p>He  first  destroyed  the  complete  rocky  land  but  he  could  not  do  it  perfectly   because  he  lacked  strength  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>Afterwards,  he  used  his  create  dream  killer  move  to  create  earth  spikes  and   used  earth  trenches  and  caverns  to  kill  the  four-armed  ape.</p>
<p>This  step  was  quite  difficult.</p>
<p>If  he  did  not  have  create  dream,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  would  have  no  earth   spikes,  the  four-armed  ape  would  have  lived  for  a  very  long  period.  He   would  need  to  wait  for  it  to  die  of  hunger  before  the  immortal  aperture   blessed  land  could  digested  it  slowly  to  obtain  strength  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>Using  the  earth  spikes,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  quickly  got  rid  of  the  four-armed   ape.</p>
<p>But  because  of  conflicting  dao  marks,  the  blessed  land  could  only  absorb   most  of  the  strength  path  dao  marks  and  not  all  of  it.  Fortunately,  this</p>
<p>portion  was  enough,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  finally  split  apart  the  complete  rock   land.</p>
<p>Next  was  painstaking  work.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  chose  a  large  island  and  began  to  crush  the  peripheral   rocky  land  into  a  large  amount  of  gravel.</p>
<p>This  was  an  arduous  task.</p>
<p>First,  he  had  to  accumulate  lightning  clouds  to  bombard  it,  then  use  fierce   wind  and  water  waves  to  erode  the  land.</p>
<p>With  strength  path  dao  marks,  the  wind  and  waves  were  much  more   forceful  than  before  but  the  efficiency  of  crushing  rocks  was  not  high.  A  lot   of  strength  had  to  be  spent  for  minimal  results.</p>
<p>In  fact,  there  were  a  lot  of  good  methods.  For  instance,  using  fire  to  heat  the   rock  surface  then  using  water  to  cool  it  immediately  would  disintegrate  the   rocks  easily.</p>
<p>But  this  dream  realm  blessed  land  did  not  have  fire  path  dao  marks  which   really  troubled  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>What  he  was  doing  now  was  the  same  as  using  a  knife  to  cut  a  tree.</p>
<p>Several  days  passed  as  he  continued  this  laborious  grinding,  gravel  filled   the  surrounding  of  the  large  island.  These  gravel  were  ground  down  by   wind  and  water,  they  were  tiny  and  smooth  like  mini  cobblestones.</p>
<p>The  work  on  the  first  large  island  was  completed,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  then   worked  on  the  second  large  island.</p>
<p>Rainwater  had  gathered  into  a  sea  around  the  islands.</p>
<p>In  actuality,  it  could  not  be  considered  a  sea,  it  was  at  most  a  large  lake.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  did  not  bother  to  create  waves  normally,  so  the  water   surface  was  smooth  as  a  mirror.  Only  when  he  needed  to  crush  the  firm</p>
<p>rocks  or  step  on  water  to  as  a  traveling  method  would  he  take  the  initiative   to  raise  the  wind  and  waves.</p>
<p>This  blessed  land  did  not  not  have  space  path  dao  marks,  it  was  not  large   and  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  could  not  teleport  even  as  a  land  spirit.</p>
<p>Time  passed  by  as  the  small  islands  were  remodeled. After  Meng  Qiu  Zhen   finished  remodeling  all  the  large  islands  and  even  seven-eight  small  islands,   he  welcomed  the  fire  path  calamity.</p>
<p>Fire  rain  fell  heavily.</p>
<p>Every  drop  of  fire  rain  was  the  size  of  a  wash  basin,  countless  fire  raindrops   struck  with  a  huge  momentum</p>
<p>The  fire  rain  fell  on  the  islands,  the  rocky  ground  and  gravel  burned   intensely.  Some  thin  gravel  even  melted,  turning  into  lava  that  slowly   flowed  towards  the  water.</p>
<p>Gradually,  the  rock  islands  with  towering  edges  began  to  transform  under   the  devastating  fire  rain.  All  the  peripheral  areas  of  the  islands  got   submerged  under  water,  the  middle  part  was  level  with  the  lake  surface,   while  the  upper  part  was  slightly  higher,  forming  a  beach  made  of  gravel.</p>
<p>Most  of  the  fire  rain  landed  on  the  water,  creating  towering  steam.  The   vapor  rose  and  gradually  formed  thick  clouds  that  covered  the  whole   blessed  land.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  was  hiding  under  the  ground  where  there  were  dense  earth   path  dao  marks  as  he  had  the  ability  to  move  underground  as  a  land  spirit.</p>
<p>He  let  the  fire  rain  wreak  havoc  while  occasionally  keeping  an  eye  on  the   rock  islands.</p>
<p>The  fire  rain  lasted  for  a  long  time  before  dissipating.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  returned  above  ground  and  sensed  that  the  temperature  had   risen  by  several  times  while  the  air  was  moist  and  hot.</p>
<p>The  whole  blessed  land  was  covered  with  thick  clouds.  As  there  was  a  large   fire  rain  just  now,  the  clouds  looked  like  a  burning  blanket.</p>
<p>How  could  it  not  be  hot?</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  used  wind  to  blow  away  these  clouds  which  immediately   cooled  the  atmosphere.</p>
<p>However,  shortly  after,  steam  condensed  in  the  sky  again,  forming  light   clouds.  It  would  probably  form  back  into  the  thick  cloud  layer  after  some   time.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  immediately  realized  that  the  fire  path  calamity  brought  a   large  number  of  fire  path  dao  marks.  He  needed  to  restrain  most  of  the  fire   path  dao  marks  and  could  let  them  interfere  with  his  arrangements.</p>
<p>“If  there  is  a  large  number  of  light  path  dao  marks,  I  can  gather  most  of  the   fire  path  dao  marks  into  an  artificial  sun.”</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  felt  some  pity.</p>
<p>This  dream  realm  blessed  land  had  light  path  dao  marks  but  they  were  so   few  that  the  blessed  land  had  always  been  dimly  lit.</p>
<p>The  plan  to  create  a  sun  was  not  possible  but  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  had  other   methods.</p>
<p>Immediately,  he  activated  create  dream  killer  move,  and  after  going  through   ten  or  so  procedures,  most  of  the  fire  path  dao  marks  were  gathered  in  the   depths  of  the  roots  of  the  large  islands.</p>
<p>Fire  path  dao  marks  were  restrained  by  the  even  denser  earth  path  dao   marks,  forming  magma  inside  the  large  islands.</p>
<p>Outside  of  the  islands,  the  temperature  fell  down  rapidly  because  of  the   decrease  in  fire  path  dao  marks.  The  light  clouds  that  were  floating  in  the   sky  would  no  longer  accumulate  by  itself.</p>
<p>“There  is  no  artificial  sun  so  there  won’t  be  hot  weather,  but  with  magma,   there  is  geothermal  energy  which  can  be  used  similarly.”</p>
<p>As  long  as  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  used  the  strength  path  dao  marks,  he  could   trigger  a  reaction  to  turn  the  large  islands  into  live  volcanoes  that  shoot  out   qi  currents  before  exploding  with  flowing  lava  and  a  large  amount  of  ash.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  mind  jolted  as  he  had  a  sudden  realization.</p>
<p>“My  blessed  land  does  not  have  qi  path  dao  marks  or  sound  path  dao  marks,   but  when  the  volcanoes  erupt,  they  will  shoot  out  qi  currents  and  create   loud  explosions.  Previously,  the  fire  rain  hit  the  lake  and  created  steam   clouds  but  there  were  no  cloud  path  dao  marks  here.”</p>
<p>“This  is  probably  the  origin  of  the  ability  to  mimic  other  paths!”</p>
<p>When  a  Gu  cultivator  cultivates  a  path  to  a  certain  level,  they  can  imitate   the  power  of  other  paths  and  reach  a  comprehensive  balance.</p>
<p>For  instance,  the  wood  path  killer  move  fleeting  bloom  imitated  the  power   of  time  path.</p>
<p>Bai  Xiang  killer  move  belonged  to  ice  and  snow  path  but  had   transformation  path  power.</p>
<p>Stone  throw  inquiry  killer  move  was  an  earth  path  move  but  had   information  path  effect.</p>
<p>After  comprehending  this  truth,  a  portion  of  the  true  meaning  of  this  dream   realm  was  absorbed  by  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.  His  heaven  path  attainment  level   increased  slightly  which  synchronized  with  the  main  body  and  other  clones.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  inspected  himself  and  found  that  although  he  had  become  a   land  spirit,  he  could  not  completely  control  the  dao  marks  of  every  path.</p>
<p>Land  spirits  controlled  heavenly  power  but  were  only  a  portion  of  the   immortal  aperture’s  accumulation.</p>
<p>For  instance,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  went  to  painstaking  efforts  to  crush  the  rocks,   it  was  in  essence  loosening  a  lump  of  earth  path  dao  marks  and  separating   them.</p>
<p>If  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  had  full  control  over  earth  path  dao  marks,  he  could  turn   the  firm  rocks  into  sand  with  just  a  thought.</p>
<p>Land  spirits  controlled  heavenly  power  but  their  usage  of  it  was  only  at  the   superficial  level.  Moreover,  he  had  to  use  wind,  water,  and  other  forces  to   crush  the  rocks.</p>
<p>So  how  could  he  deepen  this  control?</p>
<p>More  specifically  speaking,  how  could  he  turn  the  firm  rocks  into  sand?</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  immediately  thought  of  turn  sand  Gu.</p>
<p>This  Gu  could  turn  earth  and  rocks  into  fine  sand.</p>
<p>He  then  thought  of  many  killer  moves  of  different  paths  that  could  turn  the   rocks  into  sand.</p>
<p>In  an  instant,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  perception  of  killer  moves  and  Gu  worms   became  different.</p>
<p>He  could  not  put  it  in  words  or  explain  it.</p>
<p>These  insights  accumulated  in  his  mind  and  were  slightly  inferior  to  the   previous  comprehension.  Only  a  thorough  comprehension  would  increase   his  heaven  path  attainment  level.</p>
<p>Heaven  path  dream  realms  were  different  from  the  past  dream  realms.</p>
<p>To  absorb  the  true  meaning  in  the  heaven  path  dream  realms,  one  had  to   develop  the  dream  realm  blessed  land  while  also  comprehending  the  truth   of  the  operations  of  heaven  and  earth.</p>
<p>This  made  it  difficult.</p>
<p>When  Fang  Yuan  explored  human  path  dream  realms[.  The  new  theory  of   Feng  Jin  Huang,  it  can  be  of  any  path  as  long  as  it  is  a  human  dream.],  he   only  needed  to  explore  them  to  a  certain  degree  to  raise  his  attainment   levels.</p>
<p>Exploration  of  heaven  path  dream  realms  only  maintained  a  close   connection  between  the  person  and  the  heaven  path  true  meaning,  this  link   needed  to  be  comprehended  to  raise  the  attainment  level.</p>
<p>“After  all,  there  is  a  thin  line  separating  the  heaven  path  dream  realm  and   the  human.”</p>
<p>Just  as  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  was  thinking,  the  world  turned  upside  down.</p>
<p>The  whole  blessed  land  shook  intensely  and  turned  upside  down;  the  lake   overturned  and  gushed  backwards  while  the  islands  flew  and  crashed  with   each  other.</p>
<p>“What…  what’s  going  on?!”  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  expression  changed.  The   suddenly  disorder  in  the  dream  realm  gave  him  a  huge  pressure.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  quickly  activated  Dream  Armor  to  protect  himself.</p>
<p>Fortunately,  the  dream  realm’s  shaking  only  lasted  for  a  while  before   calming.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  expression  was  pale.  It  was  very  fortunate  that  he  had   dream  armor  Gu  and  he  chose  to  explore  a  mid-size  heaven  path  dream   realm  instead  of  being  greedy.</p>
<p>If  not  for  this,  he  would  have  died  in  this  calamity.</p>
<p>“This  is  not  a  development  of  the  heaven  path  dream  realm  but  an   interference  from  the  outside  world!  It  is  probably  a  venerable  who  made   the  move.”</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  thought  as  he  looked  at  the  ruins  in  front  of  him,  smiling   bitterly  at  the  scene  of  the  disorderly  blessed  land.</p>
<p>His  hard  work  and  effort  were  all  wasted!</p>
<p>“If  this  attack  occurs  few  times  more,  I  won’t  be  able  to  continue  exploring.   The  calamities  and  tribulations  will  become  increasingly  strong.  Sigh,   hopefully,  my  main  body  can  protect  me.”</p>
