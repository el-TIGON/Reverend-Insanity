        <p>:  Heaven’s  Will,  Please  Scram</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Another  Gu  Immortal  walked  out  of  the  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>This  female  immortal  wore  golden  armor,  there  was  a  golden  cape  flowing   down  her  back,  extending  from  her  shoulder  to  the  ground.</p>
<p>She  was  taller  than  normal  people  and  her  shoulders  were  broad,  when  she   walked,  her  long  legs  were  the  most  eye-catching  as  they  made  her  look   beautiful  and  elegant.</p>
<p>Her  nose  bridge  was  tall,  her  lips  were  thin  and  her  eyes  were  also  thin.  She   had  outstanding  presence,  she  was  like  born  royalty  that  ruled  above  the   common  man.  When  she  looked  at  people,  because  of  her  height,  she  often   had  to  look  down.  She  had  an  authoritative  aura  that  was  fermented   naturally  within  her,  people  would  lower  their  heads  and  not  dare  to  look  at   her  directly,  it  was  as  if  they  could  only  look  at  her  feet  in  order  to  not   offend  her.</p>
<p>She  was  Qin  Ding  Ling.</p>
<p>After  walking  out  of  the  derivation  formation,  Qin  Ding  Ling  quickly   recovered  her  senses.</p>
<p>She  turned  around  and  looked  at  the  derivation  formation  behind  her,  her   eyes  shone  with  unprecedented  brightness.</p>
<p>She  was  very  excited!</p>
<p>Her  entry  to  the  formation  gave  her  great  gains.</p>
<p>The  most  exciting  thing  that  she  obtained  from  this  derivation  formation   was  the  hope  for  Heavenly  Court  to  defeat  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,   Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable,  and  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable!</p>
<p>Why  was  that?</p>
<p>Simply  because  the  derivation  formation’s  ability  to  develop  a  Gu   cultivator’s  path  was  just  too  powerful.</p>
<p>Like  how  Qin  Ding  Ling  obtained  huge  gains  when  she  entered  the   formation  this  time.</p>
<p>This  was  not  just  her  personal  growth,  it  helped  to  push  the  entire  luck  path   forward  in  development.</p>
<p>Thanks  to  her  going  into  the  formation,  the  luck  path  of  the  world  took  a   huge  stride  forward,  obtaining  huge  development.</p>
<p>What  did  this  mean?</p>
<p>This  meant  that  as  long  as  more  luck  path  Gu  Immortals  like  Qin  Ding  Ling   entered  the  derivation  formation,  luck  path  would  develop  further.</p>
<p>When  the  number  of  times  accumulate,  the  quantitative  growth  would   trigger  a  qualitative  transformation.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  would  be  kicked  out  of  his  supreme   grandmaster  attainment  level!</p>
<p>Supreme  grandmaster  attainment  level  meant  that  the  Gu  cultivator’s   understanding  of  a  certain  path  was  equivalent  to  the  world.</p>
<p>After  Qin  Ding  Ling  entered  the  formation,  she  became  the  core  that  used   the  vast  number  of  inheritances  in  Heavenly  Court  to  deduce  many  new   research  results  of  luck  path.</p>
<p>These  new  results  were  just  some  accumulation  that  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  could  decipher  with  just  a  glance.</p>
<p>Because  these  luck  path  research  results  were  still  under  the  scope  of  the   current  profundity  of  luck  path,  it  had  not  exceeded  the  existing  limits.  It   was  a  quantitative  growth  but  not  a  qualitative  change.</p>
<p>But  once  the  quantity  accumulated,  there  would  be  a  qualitative   transformation.</p>
<p>Once  there  was  a  qualitative  change,  the  entire  world’s  luck  path  attainment   level  would  rise  by  a  level,  while  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s   attainment  level  would  lag  behind.</p>
<p>At  that  point,  he  would  no  longer  be  a  luck  path  supreme  grandmaster!</p>
<p>In  that  case,  he  would  not  be  a  Dao  Lord  anymore  and  would  not  be  able  to   refine  natural  luck  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>That  would  be  a  disastrous  blow  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable!</p>
<p>“It  is  a  pity  that  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  been  protecting  luck   path  from  getting  spread  widely  in  the  world.”</p>
<p>“Otherwise,  if  there  are  more  luck  path  Gu  Immortals  like  me  to  enter  the   derivation  formation,  we  will  be  able  to  kick  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   out  of  supreme  grandmaster  attainment  level.”</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  expressed  her  pity  towards  this.</p>
<p>After  leaving  the  derivation  formation,  she  would  not  be  able  to  enter  for  a   long  time.  Going  in  forcefully  would  not  have  any  gains  but  instead  cause</p>
<p>her  irreparable  harm.</p>
<p>It  was  too  late  to  start  nurturing  luck  path  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Only  a  peak  rank  eight  Gu  cultivator  like  Qin  Ding  Ling  could  promote  the   advancement  of  the  entire  luck  path.</p>
<p>Of  course,  it  was  not  impossible  for  other  luck  path  Gu  Immortals  or  Gu   Masters.</p>
<p>But  they  had  not  reached  the  apex  of  luck  path,  it  was  simply  too  hard  to   exceed  the  current  accomplishments  of  heaven  and  earth.</p>
<p>For  Heavenly  Court,  this  was  too  costly  to  try  and  the  gains  they  could   derive  from  it  were  just  too  small.</p>
<p>“Next,  it  is  my  turn.”  Fairy  Maiden  Soul  smiled  at  Qin  Ding  Ling  as  she   walked  past  the  latter.</p>
<p>Fairy  Maiden  Soul  went  into  the  derivation  formation  and  vanished.</p>
<p>She  was  Heavenly  Court’s  soul  path  great  expert  from  Spectral  Soul’s  era,   she  was  on  par  with  Thunder  Ghost  True  Monarch.</p>
<p>This  entry  into  the  formation  would  derive  great  gains,  it  would  promote  the   development  of  the  world’s  soul  path.</p>
<p>“It  is  a  pity  that  Heavenly  Court  currently  lacks  refinement  path  great   experts.  There  are  many  refinement  path  Gu  Immortals  in  the  ten  great   ancient  sects  but  few  are  rank  eight.  Furthermore,  none  are  great  experts   who  have  reached  a  certain  height  of  refinement  path.”</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  pondered.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  derivation  formation  showed  the  terrifying  power  of  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable!</p>
<p>But  to  kick  a  venerable  out  of  supreme  grandmaster  attainment  level,  the   difficulty  was  too  high.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  luck  path,  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable’s  soul  path,  and  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable’s  refinement   path.  There  was  a  need  to  have  many  Gu  cultivators  in  these  three  paths.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  the  derivation  formation  but  rank  nine  derivation  Gu   was  not  refined  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  thus,  it  was  still   wild  and  took  in  natural  essence  on  its  own.</p>
<p>As  a  result,  the  derivation  formation  needed  very  little  immortal  essence  to   operate.</p>
<p>But  Heavenly  Court  lacked  crucial  members.</p>
<p>Without  enough  great  experts  in  these  paths,  the  derivation  formation  could   not  kick  the  venerables  out  of  their  thrones.</p>
<p>“Maybe,  this  is  the  reason  why  Heavenly  Court  needs  to  focus  on   developing  human  path?”  Qin  Ding  Ling  had  a  flash  of  inspiration.</p>
<p>She  could  only  see  a  small  part  of  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   plan,  she  could  not  decipher  the  big  picture.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>The  sea  was  calm  without  any  waves.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  was  at  the  crucial  moment  of  his  immortal  ascension.</p>
<p>Heaven,  earth  and  human  qi  had  already  surrounded  him  completely.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  gritted  his  teeth  as  he  did  his  best  to  balance  the  three   qi,  condensing  them  as  much  as  he  could.</p>
<p>“I  must  succeed!”</p>
<p>“I  need  to  become  a  Gu  Immortal  to  save  my  mother.”</p>
<p>“Also,  I  need  to  become  a  Gu  Immortal  and  gain  more  strength  to  find  my   father!”</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  cheered  himself  on,  but  soon,  most  of  his  attention  was   diverted  to  something  else.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  he  sensed  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>This  was  the  moment  for  natural  inspiration!</p>
<p>“You  must  succeed.”  The  mermaid  immortal  Lian  Ke  Xin  floated  in  the  air   openly  as  she  appeared  right  beside  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang.</p>
<p>Her  eyes  did  not  move  at  all,  she  stared  at  him  fixedly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  the  process  of  balancing  the  three  qi  could  not  be   interrupted,  otherwise,  Lian  Ke  Xin  would  rather  do  it  for  him.</p>
<p>This  time,  she  had  taken  the  mission  from  the  mission  board  to   ’accidentally’  meet  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  and  coax  him  to  go  to  a  place   suitable  for  immortal  ascension.</p>
<p>The  truth  was,  Fang  Yuan  secretly  opened  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s   door  to  bring  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  to  the  five  regions.</p>
<p>While  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  was  undergoing  tribulation,  Fang  Yuan  hid  near   him  but  was  not  idling.</p>
<p>He  was  secretly  using  a  powerful  rank  nine  heaven  path  killer  move.</p>
<p>It  was  not  obscured  heavenly  secret,  this  was  —  Stealing  Heavenly  Secret!</p>
<p>After  activating  this  move,  one  could  steal  the  knowledge  of  heaven’s  will   when  a  Gu  Master  undergoes  ascension  and  experiences  natural  inspiration.</p>
<p>Stealing  heavenly  secret  killer  move’s  first  core  was  the  rank  nine  heavenly   secret  Immortal  Gu,  the  second  core  was  rank  eight  great  thief  Immortal   Gu.</p>
<p>Back  then,  when  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  first  created  rank  eight   heavenly  secret  Gu,  the  initial  goal  was  to  use  it  to  sense  heaven  and  earth,</p>
<p>attempting  to  artificially  enter  natural  inspiration.</p>
<p>Normally,  a  Gu  cultivator  would  only  have  one  opportunity  at  natural   inspiration  in  their  life.</p>
<p>When  a  Gu  Master  undergoes  immortal  ascension,  they  would  use  the   opportunity  when  the  aperture  turns  into  an  immortal  aperture  world  to  gain   the  recognition  of  heaven’s  will  and  communicate  with  it.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  the  Gu  Master  would  be  able  to  ask  heaven’s  will  questions,   and  their  inquiries  would  be  answered  to  a  certain  extent.</p>
<p>This  was  a  once  in  a  lifetime  opportunity  but  the  extent  of  answers  was   limited.</p>
<p>Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  succeeded.</p>
<p>There  were  no  events  in  the  world  that  heaven  and  earth  did  not  know  of.</p>
<p>Just  using  rank  eight  heavenly  secret  Gu  would  allow  the  Gu  cultivator  to   ask  heaven’s  will  and  get  an  answer.  It  was  able  to  expose  the  secrets  of   heaven  and  earth,  even  without  any  evidence,  the  Gu  Immortal  could  reach   the  truth.</p>
<p>By  using  heavenly  secret  Gu  with  other  Gu  worms,  before  undergoing   tribulation,  they  would  be  able  to  find  out  the  content  of  the  calamities  and   tribulations  to  make  appropriate  countermeasures.</p>
<p>And  in  terms  of  concealment,  obscured  heavenly  secret  was  the  best   example.</p>
<p>If  Fang  Yuan  used  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu  alone,  he  would  not  be  able   to  get  any  answers  from  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>Because  heaven’s  will  did  not  like  him.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  one  of  the  main  culprits  who  destroyed  fate  Gu,  heaven’s   will  had  been  trying  to  kill  him  the  entire  time.</p>
<p>With  such  a  relationship,  how  could  heaven’s  will  give  him  any  answers?</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  understood  the  advantages  of  natural  inspiration.  Earlier  in  the   battle  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  why  did  he  produce  so  many  powerful  killer   moves?</p>
<p>Other  than  self  deduction,  he  had  also  secretly  used  the  natural  inspiration   of  many  Gu  Masters  in  his  immortal  aperture  when  they  ascended,  saving   him  precious  time  and  energy.</p>
<p>Without  these  exceptional  killer  moves,  Fang  Yuan  would  have  gotten   killed  by  the  two  venerables.</p>
<p>Thus,  natural  inspiration  was  a  huge  reason  why  Fang  Yuan  emerged   victorious  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave.</p>
<p>Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  more  natural  inspiration   opportunities,  so  did  Fang  Yuan!</p>
<p>Every  Gu  cultivator  knew  the  precious  value  of  natural  inspiration.</p>
<p>To  do  this,  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  created  rank  eight  heavenly   secret  Gu,  what  about  Fang  Yuan?</p>
<p>He  made  stealing  heavenly  secret  killer  move.</p>
<p>This  killer  move  was  created  long  ago,  but  it  was  only  rank  eight  then  and   had  limited  strength.</p>
<p>Honestly  speaking,  it  was  worthless.</p>
<p>Too  much  immortal  essence  was  expended  for  too  little  gains.</p>
<p>He  might  as  well  order  Gu  Masters  to  ask  specific  questions  during  their   natural  inspiration.</p>
<p>But  this  was  in  the  past.</p>
<p>Right  now,  the  situation  had  changed  greatly.</p>
<p>The  reason  was  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu!</p>
<p>Where  did  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu  originate  from?</p>
<p>Truthful  floating  ice.</p>
<p>This  was  Limitless  Demon  Venerable’s  arrangement,  he  had  used  the  chaos   outside  the  world  to  fuel  the  Crazed  Demon  formation,  it  was  a  grand   accomplishment  from  countless  years  of  effort.</p>
<p>Starting  from  the  eighth  layer,  Crazed  Demon  Cave  was  isolated  from  the   five  regions.  Crazed  Demon  formation  was  no  exception.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  refined  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu  in  his  own  sovereign   immortal  aperture,  it  was  also  isolated  from  the  five  regions.</p>
<p>This  meant  that  the  current  Gu  cultivation  world  did  not  have  the  recipe  of   rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu.</p>
<p>By  having  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu,  on  just  this  point,  Fang  Yuan  was   already  above  the  entire  world!</p>
<p>Rank  eight  stealing  heavenly  secret  had  limited  power  but  rank  nine   stealing  heavenly  secret  was  above  the  world,  it  surpassed  even  heaven’s   will!</p>
<p>Each  time  there  was  a  Gu  Master  undergoing  natural  inspiration,  Fang  Yuan   would  activate  rank  nine  stealing  heavenly  secret  killer  move.</p>
<p>The  gains  were  simply  unimaginably  immense!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  a  chance  to  observe  everything  that  happened  in  the  world.</p>
<p>In  normal  situations,  the  natural  inspiration  of  Gu  Masters  was  limited,  this   was  the  restriction  set  by  heaven’s  will.  But  Fang  Yuan’s  stealing  heavenly   secret  could  directly  steal  the  answer,  it  did  not  matter  what  heaven’s  will   intended  to  do!</p>
