    <p>:  Fang  Yuan’s  Scheme  To  Blow  Up  Heavenly  Court</p>
<p>This  huge  explosion  was  too  sudden,  it  had  occurred  too  fiercely!</p>
<p>At  once,  winds  soared  and  clouds  dispersed,  heaven  and  earth  changed   colors.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  shattered!</p>
<p>A  large  number  of  grotto-heaven  fragments  flew  everywhere  like  a  volcanic   explosion.  Only  half  of  the  immortal  aperture  entrance  remained,  there  were   all  sorts  of  holes  and  gaps  everywhere,  exposed  in  spectral  heaven.</p>
<p>Dust  and  smoke  rumbled,  Heavenly  Court  could  not  be  seen  clearly  now.</p>
<p>An  unknown  number  of  Gu  Immortals  had  died.</p>
<p>The  only  thing  that  could  be  confirmed  was  that  the  mountain-like  qi   harvest  fruit  had  dissipated  entirely.</p>
<p>“I  succeeded…”  In  Central  Continent,  Fang  Yuan  looked  in  the  direction  of   Heavenly  Court  and  let  out  a  breath  of  air.</p>
<p>Long  ago,  he  had  already  started  to  consider  this  issue.</p>
<p>At  that  time,  he  was  in  a  predicament  with  danger  all  around  him.</p>
<p>The  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  time  flow  was  too  fast,  this  forced  Fang   Yuan  to  undergo  tribulations.  Although  he  had  used  endless  trouble  multiple   times  to  delay  his  tribulations,  the  chaotic  disaster  could  not  be  skipped  by   this  method.</p>
<p>Once  Fang  Yuan  underwent  tribulation,  he  would  need  to  place  his   sovereign  immortal  aperture  in  spectral  heaven  and  open  his  immortal   aperture’s  entrance  for  some  time.</p>
<p>This  would  expose  a  huge  flaw  and  lure  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  to  attack  him,  even  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable  might  come!</p>
<p>Other  than  the  danger  of  tribulation,  Fang  Yuan  also  felt  hunger.</p>
<p>This  was  the  sovereign  immortal  body’s  hunger.</p>
<p>The  sovereign  immortal  body  was  created  using  sovereign  immortal  fetus   Gu,  the  flaw  was  that  it  needed  to  consume  an  immortal  aperture  of  the   same  rank  as  the  Gu  Immortal  once  in  a  while.</p>
<p>Now  that  Fang  Yuan  was  a  venerable,  he  would  need  to  annex  a  rank  nine   immortal  aperture!</p>
<p>These  two  crises  made  Fang  Yuan  extremely  worried.</p>
<p>As  the  saying  went:  If  one  did  not  have  big  worries,  they  would  worry   about  smaller  things.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  great  foresight,  he  could  also  anticipate  his  future  problems.   Rather  than  leaving  these  issues  to  the  future,  he  should  start  resolving  them   now!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  have  a  passive  nature,  he  enjoyed  taking  the  initiative  to   launch  the  first  attack  and  control  the  situation!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  one  of  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival   methods.</p>
<p>The  reason  was  simple.</p>
<p>The  killer  move  stealing  heavenly  secret.</p>
<p>Back  then,  Fang  Yuan  used  the  immortal  ascension  of  his  Gu  Immortal   seeds  to  experience  natural  inspiration  and  use  stealing  heavenly  secret  to   inspect  all  the  secrets  within  Heavenly  Court!</p>
<p>He  knew  the  profundities  contained  in  the  qi  harvest  fruit  were  meant  to   revive  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Even  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  unclear  of  the  exact  details   regarding  the  qi  harvest  fruit  revival  method.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  had  a  clear  understanding  of  Heavenly  Court,  along  with  his   qi  path  great  grandmaster  attainment  level,  he  made  deductions  and   research  with  wisdom  Gu’s  help.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  made  arrangements  within  the  star   array  calculation  formation,  her  methods  were  precise  and  meticulous.  The   intention  was  to  use  both  Embroidered  Tower  and  Star  Constellation   Chessboard  to  capture  a  pseudo  venerable.</p>
<p>This  arrangement  was  done  secretly,  Fang  Yuan  did  not  know  of  it.</p>
<p>But  he  did  not  need  to  guess  to  know  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  would  definitely  try  to  revive  Primordial  Origin  Immortal   Venerable!</p>
<p>If  he  were  in  her  shoes,  it  was  certain  that  he  would  prioritize  in  reviving   the  other  two  Immortal  Kings  of  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Things  were  difficult  to  do  openly,  but  easy  to  do  secretly.  Once  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  made  a  move,  her  every  action  would</p>
<p>expose  her  intention.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  deep  foundations,  it  was  under  the  rule  of  three   Immortal  Kings.  This  was  Heavenly  Court’s  greatest  strength,  but  to  Fang   Yuan,  it  also  was  their  greatest  weakness.</p>
<p>Thus,  Fang  Yuan  thought  of  sacrificing  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  to  purposely  lure   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  into  using  the  qi  harvest  fruit  revival   method.</p>
<p>Even  if  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  his  clone,  so  what?</p>
<p>For  the  goal  of  eternal  life,  what  could  he  not  sacrifice?</p>
<p>For  the  sake  of  his  grand  ambition,  would  Fang  Yuan  be  stingy  on  such  a   sacrifice?</p>
<p>The  plan  to  give  up  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  use  him  as  bait  to  revive   Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  was  quite  likely  to  succeed.</p>
<p>But  he  needed  a  chance  to  send  Qi  Sea  there.</p>
<p>He  could  not  do  it  openly.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  the  number  one  person  in   wisdom  path,  Fang  Yuan  had  experienced  her  strength  countless  times,  she   often  saw  through  his  plans  when  they  were  still  at  their  initial  stage.  There   was  a  clear  example  previously  with  Fang  clan.</p>
<p>If  he  did  it  in  a  way  that  was  too  obvious,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  would  notice  and  use  the  plan  against  him,  causing  Fang  Yuan   huge  losses.</p>
<p>Thus,  he  waited  until  the  opportunity  presented  itself.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly,  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  appeared  at  the  best  timing!</p>
<p>For  Fang  Yuan’s  case,  although  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  could  raise   his  heaven  path  attainment  level,  he  was  not  anxious  to  get  them.</p>
<p>As  long  as  nobody  could  make  use  of  these  heaven  path  dream  realms,  he   could  continue  to  refine  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  secretly,  to  raise  his   strength  and  pull  apart  his  distance  from  the  other  venerables.</p>
<p>The  longer  this  dragged  on,  the  stronger  Fang  Yuan  would  become.</p>
<p>But  the  contest  over  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  became  the  best  red   herring  to  conceal  his  scheme  to  give  up  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  to  the  enemy!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  thought  a  lot  about  this,  he  made  difficult  choices.</p>
<p>He  could  not  act  too  willing,  everything  had  to  be  logical.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  intelligence  was  unfathomable,  she   was  too  smart.  But  her  wisdom  was  something  that  Fang  Yuan  could  make   use  of!</p>
<p>Thus,  Fang  Yuan  sent  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  into  the  star  array  calculation   formation  and  did  not  do  anything  excessive.  Afterwards,  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  personally  ’helped’  Fang  Yuan  and  completed  the   arrangements  for  him,  capturing  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>Throughout  the  process,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  kept  in  the  dark  by  Fang   Yuan,  he  was  unaware.</p>
<p>Not  just  him,  Wu  Shuai  and  Zhan  Bu  Du  did  not  know  either.</p>
<p>It  was  like  how  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  deceived  the  five   immortals  from  Heavenly  Court  regarding  the  plan  to  take  Lin  Jian  Xing’s   otherworldly  sword  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  was  even  more  ruthless,  he  even  deceived  himself.</p>
<p>Giving  up  the  Qi  Sea  clone  was  not  enough,  to  assure  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable,  he  even  gave  up  the  qi  path  Immortal  Gu  and  Hu   Land.</p>
<p>So  what  if  he  had  to  give  up  these  qi  path  Immortal  Gu?</p>
<p>As  long  as  he  could  achieve  his  goal,  Fang  Yuan  could  even  give  up  rank   nine  Immortal  Gu!</p>
<p>Hu  Land…  wasn’t  it  just  a  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth?</p>
<p>If  it  could  deceive  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  for  some  time,  not   to  mention  one  secluded  domain,  he  would  even  give  up  three  if  he  had  to.</p>
<p>In  Fang  Yuan’s  eyes,  the  so-called  Immortal  Gu  and  secluded  domain  of   heaven  and  earth,  no  matter  how  precious,  were  just  tools  for  him  to  go   after  eternal  life.</p>
<p>Since  they  were  tools,  if  there  was  value  in  sacrificing  them,  he  would  do  it!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  no  hesitation  regarding  this.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  only  had  a  vague  understanding  of   the  qi  harvest  fruit  revival  method,  but  Fang  Yuan  knew  it  clearly.</p>
<p>He  was  a  refinement  path  venerable,  he  was  also  proficient  at  revival   methods.</p>
<p>From  the  perspective  of  refinement  path,  the  qi  harvest  fruit  revival  method   was  just  using  the  qi  harvest  fruit  as  the  main  material,  along  with   Primordial  Origin’s  arrangements  in  Heavenly  Court,  to  create  a  new  body   and  soul.</p>
<p>Was  it  any  different  from  Gu  refinement  in  essence?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>In  that  case,  Fang  Yuan  could  make  his  arrangements.</p>
<p>He  first  treated  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  as  a  qi  path  immortal  material  and   processed  some  steps  in  advance.  Of  course,  the  corresponding  memories   were  already  removed  from  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>It  was  like  how  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  altered  the  memories   of  the  Gu  Immortals  who  entered  the  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  entire  body  was  tampered  with,  but  this  was  related  to   the  peak  profundities  of  refinement  path,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  could  not  detect  anything  even  after  checking  many  times.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  refinement  path  attainment  too,   but  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  looked  normal  on  the  surface,  there  would  only  be   issues  after  he  was  used  as  an  immortal  material  for  the  qi  harvest  fruit   revival  method.</p>
<p>And  during  the  process  of  revival,  the  problem  would  intensify.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  completely  understand   or  control  the  qi  harvest  fruit  revival  process.</p>
<p>This  gave  Fang  Yuan  many  chances  to  take  advantage  of  the  situation!</p>
<p>“My  plan  succeeded,  as  for  the  gains,  it  will  depend  on  future   developments.”  Fang  Yuan  did  not  rush  to  attack  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>He  continued  to  plunder  Central  Continent  while  contacting  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun,  we  are  so  lucky!  A  problem  happened  during  Primordial   Origin’s  revival,  Heavenly  Court  blew  up  instead.  This  is  our  best   opportunity  to  strike,  if  we  miss  this  and  Heavenly  Court  recovers,  we  will   regret  not  taking  action  for  life.”</p>
<p>After  seeing  Heavenly  Court’s  explosion,  after  a  momentary  shock,  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable  immediately  thought  of  attacking  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>After  getting  Fang  Yuan’s  transmission,  he  became  even  more  tempted.</p>
<p>But  he  was  hesitant  now.</p>
<p>“Should  I  really  attack  Heavenly  Court  now?”</p>
<p>“Did  they  really  make  a  mistake?  Is  Fang  Yuan  behind  this?”  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  thought  of  Fang  Yuan’s  mysterious  defensive  method,   he  really  could  not  see  through  this  person.  It  was  possible  that  Fang  Yuan   was  behind  this  all  along.</p>
<p>“Strange,  why  did  I  not  sense  this  huge  variable  earlier  when  I  used  luck   inspection  on  Heavenly  Court?”</p>
<p>“Unless,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  used  a  method  to  conceal   Heavenly  Court  and  it  stopped  my  luck  inspection  from  working?  That   would  really  be  ironic.”</p>
<p>The  last  thing  that  made  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  hesitate  was  Light   Emperor.</p>
<p>His  eldest  son.</p>
<p>As  well  as  the  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu  in  his  immortal  aperture!</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  was  kidnapped  by  the  two  legendary  immemorial  beasts,   You  Tian  Guang  and  Zuo  Ye  Hui,  if  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not   go  to  save  him,  he  would  be  in  danger.</p>
<p>Of  course,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  thought  of  his  own  Blood  Sea.</p>
<p>Since  he  could  revive  Light  Emperor  once,  he  could  definitely  do  so  again.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun  is  still  hesitating,  did  he  notice  anything?”  Fang  Yuan  saw  that   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  not  taking  any  action,  he  started  to   ponder.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  know  about  the  secret  behind  Giant  Sun  and  his  son,  he   also  did  not  know  about  the  drawback  of  using  the  killer  move,  I  reside  in   all  living  beings  and  heaven  and  earth.</p>
<p>But  he  soon  thought  of  a  reason.</p>
<p>“With  the  explosion,  Heavenly  Court’s  losses  cannot  be  assessed  now.  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  injuries  are  unclear  as  well.  She  has  a</p>
<p>huge  territorial  advantage  inside  Heavenly  Court,  she  must  not  have  gotten   too  injured,  so  she  is  still  a  threat.”</p>
<p>“This  may  be  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  concern.”</p>
<p>“In  his  opinion,  my  Qi  Sea  clone  was  captured  and  Heavenly  Court   suddenly  exploded,  which  caused  Primordial  Origin’s  revival  to  fail,  so  I   am  the  most  suspicious  one.  At  the  same  time,  I  should  be  the  most  nervous   person.”</p>
<p>“I  do  not  have  my  own  stronghold,  if  Heavenly  Court’s  two  venerables  join   hands,  I  will  be  in  an  even  worse  predicament.”</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  said  the  situation  is  unclear,  he  is  hinting  to   me  that  I  should  make  a  move  first!”</p>
<p>“If  Heavenly  Court  is  truly  weakened,  he  will  come  and  join  in  the  fight  to   steal  some  benefits  himself.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  chose  to  wait  and  observe,  this  made  Fang   Yuan’s  plan  fall  short.</p>
<p>In  fact,  attacking  Heavenly  Court  now  was  abrupt  and  contained  risks.</p>
<p>Even  Fang  Yuan  did  not  know  what  condition  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  was  currently  in.</p>
<p>But  since  Fang  Yuan  had  already  planned  this  far,  would  he  not  have   backup  solution?</p>
<p>He  casted  his  gaze  at  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  who  was  far  away.</p>
<p>After  this  period  of  killing,  his  injuries  had  mostly  recovered.</p>
<p>“He  is  the  best  vanguard  that  we  can  have.”  Fang  Yuan  smiled  as  he  used   his  method.</p>
<p>Totem  killer  moves  flew  out  and  provoked  the  insane  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  continuously,  he  was  successfully  lured  into  Heavenly  Court!</p>
