        <p>:  Fang  Yuan  Versus  Star</p>
<p>Constellation</p>
<p>“You  need  me  to  die?  Hehehe,  it  is  rare  to  see  you,  Fang  Yuan,  act  so   enthusiastically.”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  smiled  at  Fang   Yuan’s  threat  but  was  slightly  shaken  inwardly.</p>
<p>In  her  several  fights  with  Fang  Yuan,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   rarely  saw  Fang  Yuan  show  such  a  firm  attitude.  It  was  clear  that  Fang  Yuan   was  bent  on  gaining  these  heaven  path  dream  realms!</p>
<p>Because  of  this,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  needed  to  stop  Fang   Yuan  even  more.</p>
<p>“We  have  not  fought  for  many  days,  you’ve  probably  made  a  lot  of   progress.”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  long  hair  started   fluttering  without  wind.</p>
<p>Her  long  dark  hair  was  like  the  dark  night,  but  countless  starlight  specks   glittered  in  between  the  hair  like  a  shrunken  milky  way,  so  dazzling  that  it   could  not  be  ignored.</p>
<p>Ding  ding  ding…</p>
<p>Innumerable  starlight  specks  flowed  out  of  her  hair  and  gathered  to  form  a   powerful  starlight  torrent.</p>
<p>This  torrent  was  made  from  countless  star  fragments  that  collided  with  each   other,  producing  clear  and  crisp  sounds.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  frowned,  he  had  not  seen  this  move  before.  He  immediately   pointed  with  his  finger,  using  the  killer  move  seven  kills  rainbow.</p>
<p>In  an  instant,  metal  path’s  yellow  light,  wood  path’s  jade-green  light,  water   path’s  light  blue  hue,  fire  path’s  red  light,  earth  path’s  brown  light,  wind   path’s  green  radiance,  and  lightning  path’s  deep  blue  light  merged  together   to  form  a  huge  drill  that  charged  towards  the  star  fragment  current.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>The  collision  produced  a  huge  explosion  first.  Shortly  after,  metallic  sounds   of  countless  star  fragments  colliding  with  each  other  resounded  in  the   battlefield.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  seven  kills  rainbow  passed  through  star  fragments  and  snaked   its  way  towards  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  smiled  as  her  body  drifted  back  like   there  was  a  gust  of  wind.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  seven  kills  rainbow  continued  to  lose  strength  as  it  passed   through  the  star  fragments.  At  first,  it  had  an  unstoppable  penetrative  force,   but  as  star  fragments  continued  to  attach  themselves  onto  it,  its  momentum   reduced  rapidly.  In  the  end,  the  light  pillar  continued  to  thin  out,  and  when   it  reached  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  it  was  just  like  a  wisp  of   smoke.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  watched  with  a  smile  on  her  face  as   the  seven  kills  rainbow  dissipated  before  her.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  frowned  slightly,  his  gaze  fixed  upon  the  star  fragments  that   were  scattered  throughout  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>Every  one  of  the  star  fragments  was  extremely  small,  they  were  not  real  star   fragments  but  created  from  the  killer  move.</p>
<p>Originally,  the  star  fragments  flickered  with  blue  light  and  gathered  to  form   an  azure  torrent.  But  now,  these  star  fragments  were  scattered,  and  as  they   absorbed  the  seven  kills  rainbow,  their  surface  became  tainted  with  colors   like  golden  yellow,  green,  blue,  red,  brown,  and  so  on.  The  sky  above  the   battlefield  was  filled  with  all  kinds  of  colors,  forming  a  gorgeous  scene.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan,  however,  sensed  intense  danger  from  this  boundless  beautiful   scenery.</p>
<p>He  continued  to  activate  killer  moves  to  probe,  but  each  of  them  showed   their  might  for  a  short  period  before  their  strength  began  to  fall  rapidly  and   were  then  absorbed  by  the  star  fragments.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  activated  another  method.</p>
<p>She  occasionally  flicked  her  fingers  or  waved  them  in  the  air.  Following  her   movement,  star  path  dao  marks  shone  in  the  battlefield  correspondingly.</p>
<p>These  star  path  dao  marks  increased  in  numbers  rapidly  while  connecting   with  each  other;  in  just  a  dozen  or  so  breaths  of  time,  they  had  constructed   the  initial  form  of  a  battlefield  killer  move!</p>
<p>How  could  Fang  Yuan  let  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  succeed  so   easily,  once  the  battlefield  killer  move  was  activated,  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  would  immediately  have  a  huge  territorial  advantage.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  immediately  acted  to  obstruct  her  but  there  was  minimal  effect.</p>
<p>The  star  fragments  protected  the  dao  marks,  even  if  Fang  Yuan  destroyed   the  star  path  dao  marks,  these  dao  marks  would  break  down  into  countless   star  fragments  and  fill  the  gaps.</p>
<p>“I  need  to  thank  you,  Fang  Yuan,  if  not  for  permanence  Gu,  there  would  not   be  these  two  moves.”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  said.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  never  heard  of  these  two  moves,  they  synchronized  with   each  other  and  were  indeed  extraordinary.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  saw  that  he  was  unable  to  resolve  this  directly,  he  decisively   stopped  probing  and  used  another  killer  move.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  his  body  released  the  light  qi  of  five  colors;  central   restriction  white-gold  saint  light  qi,  northern  restriction  jade  licorice  light   qi,  western  restriction  red  raging  flame  light  qi,  and  eastern  restriction  blue   water  light  qi.</p>
<p>The  light  qi  connected  with  each  other  but  were  distinct  individually  as   well.  They  quickly  spread  throughout  the  battlefield,  covering  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  incomplete  battlefield  killer  move  as   well  as  the  countless  star  fragments.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  nodded  slightly,  revealing  her   admiration.</p>
<p>Be  it  the  previous  seven  kills  rainbow  or  the  current  five  restriction   profound  light  qi,  they  were  both  modified  by  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>If  it  were  the  original  version,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  would   have  immediately  disrupted  them,  and  Fang  Yuan  would  have  suffered   backlash.</p>
<p>Seven  kills  rainbow’s  modification  was  quite  ordinary.  In  just  this  short   while,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  already  seen  through  it.   As  long  as  she  was  given  some  time,  she  could  deduce  a  method  to  break  it   directly.</p>
<p>But  this  five  restriction  profound  light  qi  killer  move  was  modified   properly,  besides  the  increase  in  its  power,  its  activation  speed  had  also   become  very  fast.</p>
<p>This  modification  level  surpassed  seven  kills  rainbow’s  which  showed  that   Fang  Yuan  had  paid  a  lot  attention  to  this.</p>
<p>“He  must  have  invested  a  lot  of  time  and  energy.”  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  thought.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  began  to  suffer  backlash.</p>
<p>She  did  not  have  sovereign  immortal  body  which  had  non-conflicting  dao   marks.  In  this  five  restriction  profound  light  qi,  the  stronger  the  killer   moves  she  used,  the  stronger  the  backlash  she  faced.</p>
<p>However,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  the  number  one   person  in  wisdom  path  since  ancient  times.  Five  restriction  profound  light   qi  had  been  revealed  before,  so  how  could  she  not  have  a  method  to  deal   with  it?</p>
<p>Over  this  period,  she  had  thought  of  at  least  three  ways  to  deal  with  every   method  of  Fang  Yuan’s.</p>
<p>Immediately,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  chose  to  use  the   simplest  one.</p>
<p>She  opened  the  door  of  her  immortal  aperture  slightly,  letting  out  countless   star  beasts.</p>
<p>These  star  beasts  had  varying  sizes,  they  were  as  large  as  white  whales  or  as   small  as  mosquitoes.  Some  had  huge  heads  and  horns,  some  were  soft  and   twisted,  they  were  of  all  kinds  and  shapes.</p>
<p>But  every  one  of  these  star  beasts  was  at  least  an  immemorial  desolate   beast.  Among  them,  the  leaders’  aura  and  status  were  clearly  higher,  their   gazes  even  shone  with  shrewdness  and  spirituality.</p>
<p>The  star  beasts  charged  into  five  restriction  profound  light  qi  without  any   obstruction!</p>
<p>Five  restriction  profound  light  qi  killer  move  originally  came  from  Tao  Zhu,   he  created  it  based  upon  the  five  regional  walls.  The  five  regional  walls   could  obstruct  the  living  beings  of  five  regions  but  did  not  have  much  effect   on  the  beings  of  the  two  heavens.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  deliberately  raised  these  star  path   beasts  which  were  all  from  the  two  heavens,  so  they  were  not  suppressed  by   five  restriction  profound  light  qi.</p>
<p>The  star  beasts  formed  groups  and  charged  forward  aggressively.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  activated  killer  moves  to  clear  out  area  after  area,  but  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  kept  on  adding  more  beasts,  the  star   beasts’  scale  was  still  growing  slowly.  The  star  beast  leaders  even  possessed   their  own  immortal  aperture  and  had  Gu  worms,  their  intelligence  was  not   inferior  to  a  human.</p>
<p>‘Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  seems  to  be  able  to  raise  legendary   immemorial  beasts  at  a  large  scale?!’  Fang  Yuan’s  mind  was  shook.</p>
<p>But  thinking  about  it,  he  understood  why.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  is  the  number  one  person  in   wisdom  path,  enlightening  the  star  beasts  and  giving  them  wisdom  is  her   specialty  domain.”</p>
<p>Actually,  it  was  not  just  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  the   countless  mutant  Gu  Immortals  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave  originated  from   mountains,  rocks,  wind,  fire,  and  so  on,  they  were  all  evolved  into  Gu   Immortals  by  Limitless  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>From  a  certain  angle,  in  this  aspect  of  enlightening  legendary  immemorial   desolate  beasts,  Limitless  Demon  Venerable’s  accomplishments  were  much   more  shocking  than  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  must  have  spent  countless  star  path   resources  to  nurture  so  many  star  beasts!  The  merging  of  the  two  heavens   gave  me  countless  heaven  path  immortal  materials,  it  also  gave  her  endless   star  path  resources.  It  allowed  her  to  construct  the  star  array  calculation   formation  and  even  raise  so  many  star  beasts.”  Fang  Yuan  made  a  guess   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  wealth.</p>
<p>The  truth  was,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  spent  a  very  large   amount  to  raise  so  many  star  beasts.  Not  only  did  she  use  her  gains  from  the   merging  of  two  heavens,  she  also  used  star  path  resources  from  Heavenly   Court’s  storage.</p>
<p>Looking  at  the  approaching  star  beasts,  Fang  Yuan  activated  sword  tongue   dragon  soul  killer  move  while  maintaining  five  restriction  profound  light  qi.</p>
<p>Countless  dragon  souls  flew  and  sword  qi  pervaded  the  air,  but  they  still   could  not  match  the  endless  star  beasts,  at  most  they  delayed  the  offense  of   some  star  beast  groups.</p>
<p>After  these  star  beasts  were  injured,  the  surrounding  star  fragments  mended   their  injuries  and  healed  them  rapidly.</p>
<p>If  they  were  severely  injured,  they  would  die  and  break  down  into  star   fragments.</p>
<p>Once  the  star  fragments  reached  a  certain  level  in  an  area,  they  easily   formed  star  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  three  moves  were  connected  to   each  other.  If  one  was  weakened,  the  other  would  benefit,  they  were   mutually  linked  and  made  Fang  Yuan’s  situation  increasingly  tough.</p>
<p>“Looks  like  this  is  another  one  of  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   combat  systems…”  Fang  Yuan  noticed  something.</p>
<p>His  thoughts  moved  like  lightning.</p>
<p>This  fight  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  different  from   the  battle  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave  or  the  contest  over  rank  nine  light  Gu.</p>
<p>The  battle  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave  was  to  seize  Primordial  Domain  and  the   Crazed  Demon  formation.  It  prioritized  on  strategies  and  making  use  of  the</p>
<p>situation,  it  focused  on  the  competition  of  information,  people’s  support,   and  their  respective  forces.</p>
<p>The  contest  over  rank  nine  light  Gu  was  a  pursuit  battle,  it  focused  on   speed,  initiative,  offense  and  defense.</p>
<p>This  time,  Fang  Yuan  wanted  to  seize  heaven  path  dream  realms,  the   prerequisite  to  this  was  to  take  control  of  this  battlefield  and  gain  territorial   advantage!</p>
<p>Great  minds  thought  alike,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  the   same  view.</p>
<p>Be  it  Fang  Yuan’s  five  restriction  profound  light  qi  or  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  mysterious  battlefield,  they  were  both  meant  for  this   purpose.</p>
<p>From  the  start  of  the  battle,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  directly   used  her  new  combat  system,  lowering  the  effectiveness  of  Fang  Yuan’s   five  restriction  profound  light  qi  and  other  methods.</p>
<p>On  the  other  hand,  Fang  Yuan  was  decisive,  he  saw  the  situation  getting   worse  and  immediately  stopped  all  offensive  methods,  only  defending   himself.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  saw  this  and  waved  her  sleeves,   making  all  the  star  beasts  press  forward.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  could  only  dodge  while  preparing  his  killer  move.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  eyes  shone  with  starlight  as  she   suddenly  took  out  the  lantern-like  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth.</p>
<p>Mental  Domain.</p>
<p>She  lightly  swung  Mental  Domain  towards  Fang  Yuan’s  direction.</p>
<p>Instantly,  countless  emotions  attacked  Fang  Yuan’s  mind  and  body.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  was  already  prepared,  he  activated  several  defensive  killer   moves,  among  which  was  the  killer  move,  calm  and  steady.</p>
<p>This  move  was  already  used  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  it  was  also  modified   now.  It  suppressed  and  eliminated  Fang  Yuan’s  emotions  quickly.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  succeed  in  disturbing  him,   while  Fang  Yuan  stabilized  his  footing  as  his  preparation  succeeded.  He   opened  his  mouth  slightly,  light  smoke  gushed  out  of  his  mouth  and  ears.</p>
<p>The  pink  smoke  gathered  above  Fang  Yuan’s  head  and  turned  into  a  mini   image  of  Dang  Hun  Mountain.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  the  killer  move  activated  as  the  mini  Dang  Hun   Mountain  shook  intensely.</p>
<p>Ding—— ！</p>
<p>Ding—— ！</p>
<p>Ding—— ！</p>
<p>Sounds  of  crystals  colliding  resounded  in  the  battlefield,  and  soon,  the   sound  became  ear-piercing.</p>
<p>The  pink  sound  waves  were  visible  to  the  naked  eyes,  wherever  they  went,   star  beasts  cried  in  pain,  freezing  on  the  spot  before  crumbling  apart.</p>
<p>The  battlefield  that  was  filled  with  star  beasts  became  empty  instantly.</p>
<p>Even  the  stronger  star  beast  leaders  were  unable  to  resist  as  they  collapsed   amidst  the  pink  sound  waves.</p>
<p>Not  only  this,  even  the  endless  star  fragments  also  disintegrated  and   disappeared.  The  surrounding  star  path  dao  marks  were  broken  in   succession  and  drowned  in  the  pink  sound  waves.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and   Dang  Hun  Sound!</p>
<p>One  move  swept  the  whole  battlefield  and  changed  the  situation  easily,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  aghast,  her  expression  changed.</p>
