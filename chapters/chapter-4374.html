    <p>:  Eight-Desolate  Sword  Leaf  Tree</p>
<p>The  formation  grandmaster  calculated  with  all  his  efforts,  after  a  while,  he   said  with  perspiration  running  down  his  face:  ”I  need  five  hundred   kilograms  of  rank  eight  immortal  material,  heavy  sand,  to  temporarily  cover   the  shortage  of  this  formation  core.”</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji’s  heart  sank,  heavy  sand  was  a  specialty  product  of  Western  Desert   and  was  not  produced  in  other  four  regions.  How  could  he  collect  such  a   large  amount  of  heavy  sand  at  this  moment?</p>
<p>Just  as  Zhang  Ji  was  worried,  the  formation  grandmaster  let  out  a  breath  of   turbid  air  and  said:  ”You  can  get  heavy  sand  from  Heavenly  Court’s  storage,   but  I  need  someone  to  go  to  spectral  heaven  and  pour  at  least  two  hundred   and  fifty  kilograms  from  top  to  bottom.  At  that  time,  we  will  cooperate  with   that  person  from  inside  the  formation  and  fill  the  hole.”</p>
<p>“I  will  go!”  Zhang  Ji  immediately  said.</p>
<p>The  formation  grandmaster  shook  his  head,  saying  directly:  ”Your  injuries   have  only  been  suppressed  and  you  are  too  weak.  If  you  rashly  exit  the   formation,  you  will  be  killed  by  those  three  demons  easily.  Those  three   demons  will  gain  clues  and  know  the  approximate  location  of  this  formation   space!”</p>
<p>“Then  what  should  we  do?”  Zhang  Ji  sighed  bitterly.</p>
<p>The  formation  grandmaster  was  slightly  dazed  as  he  received  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  instructions,  saying:  ”Alright,  be  it   immortal  materials  or  manpower,  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  will  personally  make  arrangements.  Zhang  Ji,  use  this  time  to   heal  your  injuries  quickly.  I  will  go  to  the  next  formation  core  and  prepare   the  method  to  fix  it.”</p>
<p>The  formation  grandmaster  left  hurriedly.</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji  looked  at  his  receding  figure  before  turning  to  observe  his   surroundings,  only  seeing  chaos  and  commotion  in  the  formation  space.   The  Gu  Immortals  who  were  stationed  here  were  running  everywhere.</p>
<p>Even  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  will  personally   attending  to  this  place,  Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones  posed  a  huge  threat  to   them.</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji  could  deeply  feel  his  powerlessness,  he  sighed  helplessly  and   started  healing  his  injuries.</p>
<p>Western  Desert.</p>
<p>Lin  clan’s  blessed  land  headquarters.</p>
<p>Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder,  the  number  one  Gu  Immortal  in  the  present   Western  Desert,  Lin  Jian  Xing  walked  out  of  the  blessed  land  with  Nine   Spiritual  Fairy.</p>
<p>“I  wish  you  a  smooth  journey.”  Lin  Jian  Xing  smiled.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  wanted  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  body  to  create  Bo  Qing  and  restrain   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  and  four  other   Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  surrounded  and  attacked  Lin  Jian  Xing  but   suffered  a  miserable  defeat.  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  covered  the  retreat  and  was   captured  by  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>But  now,  she  was  being  personally  released  by  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>Nine  Spiritual  Fairy’s  expression  was  heavy,  she  did  not  feel  happy  when   regaining  freedom.  She  looked  at  Lin  Jian  Xing  and  asked:  ”What  did   Heavenly  Court  pay  you  to  release  me?”</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  said  directly:  ”Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  places  a   great  importance  on  you,  I  daringly  to  make  an  offer  and  obtained  eleven   eight-desolate  sword  leaf  trees  fortunately.”</p>
<p>“Eight-desolate  sword  leaf  tree….”  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy’s  heart  became   even  heavier.</p>
<p>The  story  behind  these  eight-desolate  sword  leaf  trees  was  huge,  they   originated  from  Genesis  Lotus  Immortal  Venerable.  They  were  immemorial   desolate  plants  created  by  the  venerable  and  were  not  a  naturally  produced   resource.</p>
<p>Eight-desolate  sword  leaf  tree  contained  a  dense  number  of  wood  path  dao   marks  but  it  grew  on  ore  mines  with  metal  path  immortal  materials,  and  the   leaves  it  produced  were  rank  eight  sword  path  immortal  materials.</p>
<p>These  eight-desolate  sword  leaf  trees  were  unique  resources.  Genesis  Lotus   Immortal  Venerable  grew  them  personally  and  only  left  twenty  or  so  trees   in  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>A  number  of  the  eight-desolate  sword  leaf  trees  died  or  were  expended  in   the  following  period  after  his  death.  Only  these  eleven  trees  were  left  now   and  they  were  all  obtained  by  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  accompanied  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  till  the  previous  regional   wall  area  that  spanned  across  Western  Desert,  Central  Continent,  and   Northern  Plains.  He  then  watched  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  leave  alone.</p>
<p>“When  I  was  negotiating  with  Star  Constellation’s  will,  we  were  always   deadlocked  over  the  price.  I  did  not  expect  Star  Constellation’s  will  to   suddenly  be  willing  to  hand  me  eleven  eight-desolate  sword  leaf  trees  but</p>
<p>they  wanted  me  to  provide  one  hundred  kilograms  of  heavy  sand  along  with   the  release  of  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy.”</p>
<p>“I  have  really  made  a  huge  gain  by  getting  these  eleven  eight-desolate   sword  leaf  trees.  My  guess  was  not  wrong,  as  long  as  I  can  gain  some   comprehension  from  them,  the  recreation  of  my  sword  forest  will  just  be   around  the  corner.”</p>
<p>“Heavenly  Court  has  too  many  assets  and  an  extremely  deep  foundation.   Even  after  repeated  losses  in  battle,  their  foundation  still  cannot  be  matched   by  other  super  forces.”</p>
<p>“What  a  pity  that  I  was  only  able  to  capture  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy.  Otherwise,   I  could  have  demanded  even  more  cultivation  resources  from  Heavenly   Court.”</p>
<p>The  destruction  of  fate  Gu  had  a  lasting  influence  on  the  whole  world  and   even  Gu  cultivators.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  possessed  the  immortal  graveyard,  their  Gu  Immortals   could  revive  after  death.  So  it  was  a  great  battle  tactic  for  them  to  seek   death  and  not  care  for  their  life.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  went  even  further  in  this  aspect,  he  intentionally  revived  Gu   Immortals  as  Gu  Masters  to  make  them  undergo  immortal  ascension  again,   using  stealing  heavenly  secret  to  make  huge  gains.</p>
<p>So  even  if  Lin  Jian  Xing  killed  Heavenly  Court’s  members,  there  would  not   be  a  huge  grudge.  They  could  revive  anyway!</p>
<p>On  the  contrary,  he  was  able  to  capture  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  alive  and   stopped  her  from  dying  which  instead  became  an  issue  for  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>After  a  long  period  of  negotiations,  Heavenly  Court  finally  redeemed  this   captive  by  giving  Lin  Jian  Xing  what  he  wanted.</p>
<p>“It  is  a  pity  that  my  sword  path  is  strong  in  offense  but  not  that  proficient  in   capturing  methods.”</p>
<p>“Sigh,  this  world  is  quite  extraordinary.  My  former  world  focused  on   cultivation  methods,  but  this  world  prioritizes  Gu  worms,  immortal  essence,   immortal  materials,  and  other  cultivation  resources.”</p>
<p>“Cultivation  resources  are  the  foundation  of  everything.  This  confrontation   of  venerables  is  the  perfect  time  for  my  Lin  clan  to  expand.  If  a  victor  is   decided  between  the  venerables  and  I  am  still  not  a  sword  path  venerable,  I   may  have  no  choice  other  than  to  submit  to  the  winner.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  previous  deduction  was  not  wrong,   Lin  Jian  Xing  was  indeed  an  otherworldly  demon.  In  his  former  world,  he   was  the  head  of  a  Sword  Sect  and  was  known  as  the  Grand  Ancestor.</p>
<p>Such  a  person  was  naturally  not  willing  to  be  subservient,  he  was  a  person   who  had  seen  through  worldly  affairs  and  was  full  of  ambitions.</p>
<p>So,  after  Lin  Jian  Xing  defeated  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals,  he  did   not  give  any  explanations.  He  was  actually  happy  to  be  treated  as  a  demonic   path  member.</p>
<p>What  would  he,  a  grand  sword  path  pseudo  venerable,  fear?</p>
<p>Would  he  fear  other  Western  Desert  super  forces?  Laughable!</p>
<p>The  ones  who  hoped  he,  Lin  Jian  Xing,  clarified  that  he  and  Lin  clan  were   in  the  righteous  path  were  these  Western  Desert  super  forces.</p>
<p>If  so,  Lin  clan  would  be  restrained  under  the  rules  of  the  righteous  path  and   be  unable  to  expand  freely.</p>
<p>But  so  what  if  he  explained  himself?</p>
<p>Was  Lin  clan  not  a  righteous  path  super  force  previously?  It  did  not  matter,   Heavenly  Court  still  attacked  without  a  reason.  This  was  the  number  one   righteous  path  super  force  in  the  world!</p>
<p>On  the  contrary,  joining  demonic  path  was  much  better  for  Lin  clan  to   annex  other  forces  and  expand  wantonly!</p>
<p>Naturally,  even  Lin  Jian  Xing  could  not  resist  a  venerable’s  attack.</p>
<p>But  did  that  mean  he  had  to  give  up?</p>
<p>There  was  no  such  logic  in  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  heart!</p>
<p>If  one  was  weak,  they  needed  to  do  everything  to  become  stronger,  to   become  an  expert.  It  was  because  they  would  be  bullied  that  they  had  to   grab  every  chance  to  resist  and  become  stronger.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  had  such  thoughts  and  did  just  that.</p>
<p>He  had  already  made  enough  mental  preparation,  he  would  bear  the   responsibility  even  if  a  venerable  targeted  him  in  the  future.</p>
<p>As  long  as  he  could  preserve  his  life,  he  would  surrender  to  the  venerables.   He  might  even  be  lucky  and  get  the  venerable’s  support,  making  even   greater  achievements!</p>
<p>After  sending  off  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy,  Lin  Jian  Xing  did  not  return  to  the   headquarters  but  continued  to  head  north  and  entered  Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>He  turned  invisible  and  flew  rapidly,  soon  arriving  at  Flower  Forest   Forbidden  Land.</p>
<p>Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land  was  one  of  the  ten  great  fierce  areas  in   Northern  Plains  and  was  home  to  countless  mushrooms.  These  mushrooms   were  as  large  as  trees  and  the  huge  number  of  them  formed  a  vast  forest.</p>
<p>All  kinds  of  flowers  bloomed  in  the  forest,  their  aroma  permeated  the   surroundings  and  were  dense  to  the  point  of  forming  fog.</p>
<p>Every  full  moon,  the  fragrance  of  the  flowers  would  condense  into  water   droplets  that  flowed  to  the  surroundings,  nourishing  the  mushroom  trees   and  strengthening  them  further.</p>
<p>Similar  to  all  the  fierce  areas,  countless  desolate  beast  groups  lived  here   including  many  immemorial  desolate  beasts  and  plants.</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  had  been  hiding  in  the  depths  of  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land   over  these  days.</p>
<p>It  was  a  legendary  immemorial  desolate  beast,  it  was  much  easier  and  more   suitable  for  it  enter  and  live  in  fierce  areas  than  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  naturally  had  its  plans  for  hiding  in  the  Flower  Forest.</p>
<p>Its  goal  was  You  Tian  Guang  who  was  imprisoned  by  Longevity  Heaven.  It   wanted  to  save  the  latter!</p>
<p>Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land  was  a  fierce  area  in  Northern  Plains  that   could  not  only  hide  him  but  was  also  nearest  to  Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>“I  am  going  now,  the  following  plan  will  depend  on  you  two.  Don’t  think  of   running  away,  you  are  both  struck  by  my  method  and  are  not  of  Huang  Jin   bloodline,  who  will  save  you?”  Zuo  Ye  Hui  did  not  forget  to  warn  Lu  Qing   Ming  and  Su  Guang  before  leaving.</p>
<p>These  two  Gu  Immortals  were  really  unlucky.</p>
<p>They  had  wanted  to  escape  Northern  Plains  and  were  heading  towards   Western  Desert  when  they  were  caught  by  Zuo  Ye  Hui  midway  and  were   brought  to  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land.</p>
<p>The  environment  in  a  fierce  area  was  extremely  dangerous,  they  could  not   escape  with  their  strength.  If  not  for  Zuo  Ye  Hui’s  protection,  they  would   not  be  able  to  survive  even  a  day  in  this  fierce  area.</p>
<p>“We  won’t  dare,  our  lives  depend  on  you,  lord.  We  will  definitely  use  all   our  strength  for  the  plan.”  Lu  Qing  Ming  quickly  replied.</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  snorted  coldly,  its  huge  body  suddenly  turned  into  a  puddle  of   dark  liquid  that  seeped  into  the  ground  and  disappeared.</p>
<p>Lu  Qing  Ming  and  Su  Guang  were  helpless  and  could  only  follow  Zuo  Ye   Hui’s  instructions.</p>
<p>They  entered  an  immortal  formation  and  began  to  activate  it.</p>
<p>The  strength  of  the  immortal  formation  began  to  spread  to  the  surroundings,   the  whole  process  did  not  leak  any  aura  and  was  silent,  this  was  the   specialty  of  dark  path.</p>
<p>As  time  passed,  many  immemorial  desolate  beast  groups  in  Flower  Forest   Forbidden  Land  started  to  get  agitated.  Zuo  Ye  Hui  had  even  used  its   methods  on  the  leaders  of  these  beast  groups  without  them  noticing  it.</p>
<p>Most  Gu  Immortals  would  not  be  able  to  accomplish  this.  Zuo  Ye  Hui  was  a   dark  path  legendary  immemorial  beast,  it  could  be  considered  as  the   number  Gu  cultivator  in  dark  path  in  the  present  era  and  it  had  used  all  its   methods  for  this.</p>
<p>Not  long  later,  the  immemorial  beast  groups  began  to  roar  irritatedly.</p>
<p>Beasts  lacked  wisdom,  they  were  on  guard  against  each  other  and  went  into   conflict,  thus,outbreaks  started  to  occur.</p>
<p>Under  the  influence  of  the  immortal  formation,  immemorial  beast  groups   began  to  run  madly  with  their  groups.  They  completely  disrupted  the  order   of  the  whole  fierce  area,  forming  a  beast  tide  of  a  grand  scale.</p>
<p>This  beast  tide  broke  out  of  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land’s  territory  and   started  to  rush  towards  the  nearby  Huang  Jin  tribes.</p>
<p>The  Huang  Jin  tribes  were  shaken  and  immediately  asked  Longevity   Heaven  for  help.</p>
<p>In  this  situation,  Lin  Jian  Xing  arrived  in  the  sky  above  Flower  Forest   Forbidden  Land.</p>
