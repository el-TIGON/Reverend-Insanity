        <p>:  The  Power  of  Heavenly  Web!</p>
<p>Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound  was  a   compound  killer  move.</p>
<p>It  used  rank  eight  rule  path  departure  Gu,  rank  eight  wisdom  path  great   shock  Gu,  rank  eight  time  path  year  Gu,  rank  seven  dream  armor  Gu,  rank   eight  water  path  huge  wave  Gu,  rank  eight  sound  path  ringing  sound  Gu,   and  its  core  was  the  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth,  Dang  Hun   Mountain!</p>
<p>It  was  because  the  core  was  Dang  Hun  Mountain,  a  secluded  domain  of   heaven  and  earth,  that  this  move  could  be  comparable  to  a  rank  nine  killer   move.  Under  the  dao  mark  amplification  of  Fang  Yuan’s  various  paths,  its   might  was  astonishing.</p>
<p>With  just  this  move,  Fang  Yuan  immediately  broke  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  three  continuous  moves  and  alleviated  his  worsening   situation,  regaining  his  footing.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  expression  changed  as  thoughts   surged  and  moved  in  her  mind,  trying  to  analyze  this  move  with  all  her   strength.</p>
<p>“This  move  seems  like  Fang  Yuan’s  trump  card,  it  is  the  source  of  his   confidence  to  fight  me.”</p>
<p>“Roughly  analyzing  it,  this  move  contains  rule  path,  wisdom  path,  time   path,  dream  path,  water  path,  soul  path,  and  sound  path.  It  really  is  difficult   to  block  it  completely.”</p>
<p>Wisdom  path  was  fine,  but  dream  path  was  troublesome.  Despite  the  dream   path  Immortal  Gu  Dream  Armor  being  only  rank  seven,  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  did  not  have  an  effective  way  to  block  it.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  the  advantage  in  dream  path,  he  was  the  number  one  in  the   current  world!</p>
<p>“The  greatest  source  of  this  move’s  strength  is  Dang  Hun  Mountain.  How   much  time  and  energy  did  Fang  Yuan  spend  to  deduce  this  move?”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  calculated  inwardly  while  feeling   somewhat  helpless.</p>
<p>Her  painstakingly  created  new  combat  system  was  broken  by  one  move   from  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>No  matter  how  ingenious  the  three  connected  moves  was,  Fang  Yuan’s   Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound  was   extremely  domineering,  directly  clearing  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>The  thing  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  concerned  about:   the  time  and  energy  she  spent  on  these  three  moves  compared  to  Fang   Yuan’s  expenditure  in  deducing  Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave   and  Dang  Hun  Sound.</p>
<p>It  was  fine  if  her  time  and  energy  spent  was  less.</p>
<p>If  it  was  more,  her  losses  would  be  more  than  gains.</p>
<p>The  result  of  a  confrontation  between  venerables  also  signified  the   difference  in  venerables’  cultivation  and  management  methods.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  calculated  inwardly  and  felt  the   possibility  of  Fang  Yuan  expending  lesser  than  her  was  rather  low.</p>
<p>But  the  truth  was  not  so.</p>
<p>The  main  source  of  this  killer  move,  Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream   Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound,  came  from  the  nature  of  heaven  and  earth.</p>
<p>In  the  Remote  Antiquity  Era,  there  was  a  kind  of  immemorial  desolate  beast   called  shocking  year  beast,  wherever  it  went,  shocked  year  Gu  would  fly   out.  It  was  already  extinct  now.</p>
<p>Dream  wave  was  a  phenomenon,  in  Fang  Yuan’s  five  hundred  years  of  his   previous  life,  dream  wave  was  formed  when  dream  realms  appeared  at  a   large  scale.</p>
<p>There  was  no  need  to  say  much  about  Dang  Hun  Mountain.</p>
<p>Soul  sound  withered  tree  was  an  already  extinct,  rare  immemorial  desolate   plant.  It  used  wood  path  resources  as  nutrients  and  emitted  soul  sound  that   influence  the  souls  of  the  surrounding  living  beings.</p>
<p>These  phenomena  and  natural  abilities  existed  throughout  heaven  and  earth   naturally.</p>
<p>After  Fang  Yuan  gained  the  information  through  stealing  heavenly  secret,   they  became  an  important  foundational  reference  material.</p>
<p>The  creation  of  compound  killer  moves  was  actually  easier  than  an   individual  path’s  killer  moves.  Especially  when  Fang  Yuan  had  rank  eight   wisdom  Gu,  it  gave  him  accurate  inspirations,  so  he  did  not  have  to  waste   time  on  dead  ends.</p>
<p>This  Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound  was   essentially  only  a  quasi-rank  nine  killer  move  because  it  did  not  contain  a   rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Thus,  rank  eight  wisdom  Gu  was  helpful  in  deducing  this  move.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  can  you  deal  with  this  move?”   Fang  Yuan  smiled  as  he  calmly  approached  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  could  only  retreat  constantly,   maintaining  distance  from  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>It  was  difficult  to  construct  a  combat  system.</p>
<p>The  three  connected  moves  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   painstakingly  created  were  exquisite  and  already  formed  an  initial   incomplete  combat  system.</p>
<p>But  after  Fang  Yuan’s  move  unreasonably  broke  it,  the  three  connected   moves  became  a  joke.</p>
<p>Naturally,  this  did  not  mean  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   effort  ended  up  in  vain.</p>
<p>Maybe  in  the  future,  when  she  obtains  a  rank  nine  star  path  Immortal  Gu,   this  combat  system’s  power  would  rise  explosively  and  be  able  to  withstand   Fang  Yuan’s  compound  killer  move.</p>
<p>The  foundation  of  a  combat  system  were  still  the  Immortal  Gu  that  formed   it.</p>
<p>In  a  contest  of  venerables,  they  first  competed  with  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.   If  there  was  no  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,  then  they  would  contest  with   secluded  domains  of  heaven  and  earth!</p>
<p>In  this  aspect,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  possessed  the  incomplete   Blood  Sea;  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  possessed  Book   Mountain,  Mental  Domain,  and  the  Door  of  Life  and  Death;  Fang  Yuan   possessed  Dang  Hun  Mountain,  Luo  Po  Valley,  City  Well,  Reverse  Flow   River,  Hu  Land,  Refinement  Sea,  Human  Sea,  and  the  incomplete  Qian  Kun   Crystal  Wall.</p>
<p>When  the  foundation  was  solid  and  it  was  hard  to  determine  a  winner   through  fighting,  the  combat  system  became  the  biggest  factor  to  decide   victory  or  defeat.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan  really  has  extraordinary  aptitude  and  shocking  talent.  This   move  is  so  powerful  and  mysterious,  it  is  really  hard  to  block.  But  I  also   have  a  move,  please  appraise  it.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  shook  the  Mental  Domain  in  her   hand.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  immediately  looked  vigilant  and  activated  reverse  flow   protection  seal.</p>
<p>Reverse  Flow  River  was  already  restored,  reverse  flow  protection  seal  had   even  been  modified.</p>
<p>Originally,  after  the  killer  move  was  activated,  a  large  white  robe  was   formed  with  ripples  moved  along  the  surface,  this  was  the  image  of  Reverse   Flow  River  flowing  slowly.  The  surface  of  the  white  robe  had  faint  mist   surrounding  it.  There  was  also  a  strip  of  light  that  was  deep  azure,  it  was   curvy  and  wavy,  resembling  a  long  sash,  it  coiled  around  Fang  Yuan’s  arms,   the  back  of  his  neck,  and  around  his  waist  again.</p>
<p>Now,  besides  these,  Fang  Yuan’s  peerlessly  beautiful  face  was  partly  veiled   by  a  translucent  gauze,  highlighting  the  matchless  charm  in  the  depths  of   his  unconcealed  eyes.</p>
<p>The  lantern-like  Mental  Domain  shook  slightly;  in  an  instant,  the   surrounding  battlefield  dimmed.</p>
<p>Mental  Domain  was  like  the  only  source  of  light,  but  it  was  letting  out  a   mysterious  suction  force.</p>
<p>This  move’s  range  was  extremely  large,  Fang  Yuan  was  directly  struck  by   it.  His  accumulated  emotions  were  extracted  and  absorbed  by  Mental   Domain.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  immediately  used  calm  and  steady  killer  move,  but  could  not   block  this  process.</p>
<p>He  used  other  methods  as  well,  but  as  they  showed  no  effects,  his   expression  started  to  change.</p>
<p>Because  at  first,  only  emotions  were  extracted,  but  gradually,  Fang  Yuan’s   wisdom  path  dao  marks  were  also  being  extracted.</p>
<p>Wisdom  path  cultivation  focused  on  three  elements:  thoughts,  wills,  and   emotions.  Furthermore,  emotions  were  related  to  wisdom  path  dao  marks.   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  move  was  extremely  powerful,   besides  extracting  emotions,  it  could  even  extract  wisdom  path  dao  marks,   permanently  reducing  the  target’s  wisdom  path  foundation!</p>
<p>“Once  my  emotions  are  all  extracted,  my  heart  will  be  empty.  It  will  be   extremely  easy  for  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  add  in   emotions  then.”  Fang  Yuan  felt  that  the  situation  was  going  south.</p>
<p>During  the  whole  process,  his  reverse  flow  protection  seal  had  no  reaction.</p>
<p>Clearly,  this  extraction  was  extremely  subtle  and  was  not  considered  an   attack,  so  it  did  not  trigger  reverse  flow  protection  seal’s  counterattack.</p>
<p>In  fact,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  probably  created  this  move   to  target  reverse  flow  protection  seal.</p>
<p>She  succeeded.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  effort  in  modifying  reverse  flow  protection  seal  was  made   pointless.</p>
<p>In  just  a  few  breaths  of  time,  Fang  Yuan  already  lost  one  hundred  wisdom   path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>He  activated  defensive  methods  crazily,  but  even  dream  armor  Gu  showed   no  effect.</p>
<p>The  core  of  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  move  was  Mental   Domain,  it  could  be  considered  a  quasi-rank  nine  killer  move.  Adding  on   the  amplification  from  her  wisdom  path  dao  marks,  it  had  overwhelming   might.</p>
<p>Methods  like  that  of  dream  armor  Gu  were  at  a  lower  level  and  did  not  have   enough  strength  to  block  this.</p>
<p>Reverse  flow  protection  seal  was  of  a  high  level  and  had  enough  strength,   but  it  could  not  be  triggered.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  another  option,  which  was  to  continue  activating  Shocking   Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound,  using  offense  against   offense!</p>
<p>But  he  was  in  a  dilemma.</p>
<p>It  was  not  his  intention  to  fight  such  an  intense  attrition  battle  with  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.  Both  sides  would  suffer  losses,  giving   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  the  most  gains.</p>
<p>Moreover,  Fang  Yuan  did  not  want  to  fight  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable,  his  first  priority  were  the  heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>Thoughts  collided  in  Fang  Yuan’s  mind,  and  after  a  few  sparks  between  the   thoughts,  he  made  a  decision.  He  secretly  used  a  heaven  path  killer  move  —   Heavenly  Web  Protection  Veil.</p>
<p>This  move  originally  formed  a  giant  milky  white  web  outside  of  the  Gu   Immortal  to  block  attacks.  But  now,  it  quietly  turned  into  a  milky  white   light  stream  that  entered  the  thin  fishing  net  formed  from  obscured  heavenly   secret  killer  move.</p>
<p>Like  this,  the  thin  and  tightly  connected  fishing  net  possessed  the  power  of   two  killer  moves,  heavenly  web  protection  veil  and  obscured  heavenly   secret!</p>
<p>Heavenly  web  Gu  was  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Heavenly  web  protection  veil’s  defensive  power  was  higher  than  the   strength  of  Mental  Domain’s  killer  move.</p>
<p>Heavenly  web  protection  veil  had  gaps  but  nothing  was  allowed  to  pass   through.  or</p>
<p>As  the  saying  went,  the  net  of  heaven  has  large  meshes  but  it  lets  nothing   through[1.  A  Chinese  saying  similar  to  ’The  mills  of  God  grind  slowly  but   surely’.].</p>
<p>In  an  instant,  it  stopped  Fang  Yuan’s  emotions  from  being  extracted,   causing  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  exclaim  in  surprise.</p>
<p>The  even  more  amazing  thing  was  that  the  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  aura  was   not  exposed.  Because  the  two  moves  were  interconnected,  the  aura  was   concealed  by  obscured  heavenly  secret  killer  move.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  truly  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable,  after  just  a  few  exchanges,  she  forced  Fang  Yuan  to   use  his  rank  nine  heavenly  web  Gu.</p>
<p>Like  this,  obscured  heavenly  secret  killer  move  faced  a  huge  burden!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  mood  was  even  heavier.</p>
<p>She  could  not  block  Fang  Yuan’s  Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave   and  Dang  Hun  Sound,  but  Fang  Yuan  could  resist  her  Mental  Domain’s   killer  move.</p>
<p>That  meant  she  could  not  even  keep  up  the  attrition  battle  by  using  offense   against  offense.</p>
<p>“Does  Fang  Yuan  have  a  method  that  is  not  weaker  than  mine  in  terms  of   wisdom  path  deduction?”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  could  not   help  but  feel  doubtful.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  thus  gained  the  upper  hand  and  finally  had  the  leisure  time  to   deal  with  the  heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>He  did  not  attack  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  only  defended   against  her  while  targeting  those  heaven  path  dream  realms  from  afar.</p>
<p>His  first  method  was  naturally  pure  dream  reality  seeker  transformation!</p>
<p>Ordinary  dream  realms  would  be  transformed  into  Pure  Dream  Reality   Seeker  bodies  by  this  move.  But  it  had  no  effect  on  the  heaven  path  dream   realms,  not  only  this,  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  were  instead  angered   and  formed  a  tidal  wave  that  rushed  towards  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>“These  heaven  path  dream  realms  are  filled  with  heaven’s  will,  while  pure   dream  reality  seeker  transformation  condenses  a  dream  realm  into  a  human   body  with  human  will  as  the  core.  This  means  I  need  to  get  rid  of  all  the   heaven’s  will  in  the  dream  realms  first.”</p>
<p>After  learning  of  this,  Fang  Yuan  activated  heaven’s  will  dissipation  killer   move.</p>
<p>He  had  used  this  move  many  times  before  to  deal  with  dream  realms  and  its   effect  was  extraordinary.</p>
<p>But  this  time,  although  it  was  still  effective,  its  side  effect  was  much  larger.   Fang  Yuan  felt  some  heartache  as  he  watched  the  targeted  heaven  path   dream  realm  shrinking  rapidly.</p>
<p>“Seems  like  heaven’s  will  dissipation  is  usable  against  ordinary  dream   realms,  but  is  an  extremely  crude  measure  against  heaven  path  dream   realms.  It  not  only  removes  heaven’s  will,  it  even  eradicates  the  true   meaning  contained  in  the  dream  realm.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  not  without  gains,  he  realized  that  heaven’s  will  and  heaven   path  true  meaning  were  entangled  in  the  heaven  path  dream  realms,  so  they   were  hard  to  separate.</p>
<p>His  wisdom  path  methods  were  rough,  it  was  difficult  for  him  to  precisely   separate  the  two  and  target  just  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  still  had  a  way  to  deal  with  this.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  he  brought  out  his  dream  path  clone  Meng  Qiu  Zhen,   letting  him  be  devoured  by  a  heaven  path  dream  realm.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sighed,  feeling  somewhat  anxious.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  strength  was  exposed  which  made  her  quite  surprised,  he  was   actually  starting  to  take  these  heaven  path  dream  realms  right  under  her   eyes.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun,  are  you  going  to  watch  as  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable   takes  these  heaven  path  dream  realms  and  increases  his  strength?”  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  contacted  Giant  Sun.</p>
<p>“Of  course  not!”</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  showed  himself.</p>
