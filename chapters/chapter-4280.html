    <p>: Heavenly Court's Assault</p>
<p>Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling and Jun Shen Guang flew carefully in the two heavens.</p>
<p>"This Old Immortal Hua Yu is really crafty! He actually wants us to convince Flickering Light grotto-heaven first." Jun Shen Guang said begrudgingly.</p>
<p>After the two of them received the mission to make Old Immortal Hua Yu change sides, they got close to Profound Literature grotto-heaven and lurked there.</p>
<p>While Old Immortal Hua Yu was chasing away beast groups outside, they secretly met with him.</p>
<p>"Do you think Old Immortal Hua Yu is purposely wasting our time now, after we convince Flickering Light grotto-heaven to join us, he will already have his trap prepared?" Jun Shen Guang asked.</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling sighed: "This is unlikely. Old Immortal Hua Yu has been hesitating for a long time, but the reason why he is staying on the fence and being ambiguous is because he is afraid that Fang Yuan will try to kill him if he betrays him!"</p>
<p>"In this situation, he wants the attention on him to be smaller, thus, he wants to see more grotto-heavens betraying Fang Yuan, in that case, Profound Literature grotto-heaven will not be as big of a target."</p>
<p>"But the situation that you mentioned cannot be ruled out as well."</p>
<p>Jun Shen Guang asked: "Then what should we do? Flickering Light grotto- heaven is led by Gu Immortal Liang Jing Jing, but different from Old Immortal Hua Yu, we do not know much about her, we cannot be sure of her true intentions."</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling pondered for a while and said: "Even if we don't, I'm sure Old Immortal Hua Yu already has some leads. Otherwise, he would not have chosen this grotto-heaven specially for us."</p>
<p>"Maybe it is time to use that move."</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling started to fly slower as her expression became resolute, it was clear that she had made up her mind.</p>
<p>Jun Shen Guang showed a look of confusion.</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling said: "Flickering Light grotto-heaven is not far away, but before taking the risk, I want to use my luck path method to make some arrangements."</p>
<p>Jun Shen Guang asked worriedly: "Is the cost of this move too high?"</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling shook her head: "Although it will consume some of my luck path dao marks, for the sake of Heavenly Court, this is a small cost. The reason why I hesitated was because this move has a huge drawback. It is the same as using my future good luck in advance, it may have the effect of helping our enemies."</p>
<p>"So that's it." Jun Shen Guang nodded.</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling continued to speak: "But thinking about it, it is very important for us to recruit Old Immortal Hua Yu. With the contest of three venerables, for a long time in the future, this balance will continue to hold."</p>
<p>"Western Desert's Fang clan has already been driven out of their territory, if Old Immortal Hua Yu and the others betray Fang Yuan, then Heaven Refining Demon Venerable's reputation will become the lowest of the three.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Fang Yuan goes to kill Old Immortal Hua Yu, he will still face losses."</p>
<p>"For us rank eight Gu Immortals to be able to influence the situation of the three venerables, isn't it normal that the price to pay is huge?"</p>
<p>Jun Shen Guang was convinced by her: "That's true! Lady Qin Ding Ling, go ahead and use it, I will guard you."</p>
<p>Not long after, Qin Ding Ling finished her preparation and used the killer move.</p>
<p>However, this killer move took a whole hour before it ended.</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling was pale and covered in sweat, her expression was quite strange.</p>
<p>"Did something happen?" Jun Shen Guang sensed that something was wrong long ago, he quickly asked.</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling did not conceal the matter, she answered: "When I used this killer move, there was a mystical change like the entire world was responding to me. This killer move normally takes ten or so breaths to activate, but in that situation earlier, with the help of heaven and earth, I persevered and continued to use it. In the end, the move's activation took one hour."</p>
<p>Jun Shen Guang frowned: "I've heard about the secret behind the power of a Dao Lord. After a venerable refines natural dao marks, every move they make will be amplified by the dao marks, which is the resonance of heaven and earth. Lady Qin Ding Ling, why did that happen to you?"</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling shook her head: "I can't comprehend it either, but that is not a problem. On this expedition to Flickering Light grotto-heaven, we will definitely receive huge help. Let's go."</p>
<p>"Mmm."</p>
<p>The two Heavenly Court immortals continued on their way.</p>
<p>On the other side.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a loud rumbling sound, the heavenly chasm was unable to take any more hits, the weakest segment was pierced by Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's arm.</p>
<p>The two sides were connected at once.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei's and Ying Wu Xie's pupils shrunk rapidly, in an instant, they sensed an unparalleled killing intent surging from Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's body to the surroundings.</p>
<p>His killing intent was so intense that even Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie felt that they were mortals about to be engulfed by a tsunami.</p>
<p>Helplessness, despair, fear, panic, these emotions appeared naturally in them as they spread rapidly.</p>
<p>"Quickly go!" Fairy Zi Wei was a wisdom path great expert after all, she quickly reacted and used her killer move.</p>
<p>With her help, Ying Wu Xie regained his senses too.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom.</p>
<p>More and more arms pierced the heavenly chasm as they extended towards the two.</p>
<p>The rank nine heavenly chasm could trap Fairy Zi Wei or Ying Wu Xie, but it was only a small hurdle for the senseless Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie quickly retreated.</p>
<p>But suddenly, a black arm increased in speed and grabbed onto Ying Wu Xie.</p>
<p>At the moment of life and death, Ying Wu Xie activated his method.</p>
<p>Immortal killer move â€” Change Soul Technique!</p>
<p>At the next moment, he swapped position with a soul beast. This ancient soul beast took his place and got captured by Spectral Soul Demon Venerable. Meanwhile, Ying Wu Xie appeared far away and quickly escaped for his life.</p>
<p>During this period of time, Ying Wu Xie practiced hard and created his killer move, change soul technique.</p>
<p>Compared to Fang Yuan's switch soul in dream, this change soul technique had its own merits and demerits.</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie managed to escape.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable growled angrily and squeezed with his huge claw as the ancient soul beast was ground into powder, its ancient soul core was absorbed by Spectral Soul Demon Venerable instantly.</p>
<p>More and more huge claws slashed through the heavenly chasm and surrounded him.</p>
<p>Nearly ten hands opened up, an intense suction force appeared from the centers of the palms.</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie's soul beast group had no resistance at all, they were all absorbed.</p>
<p>As the claws contracted, they did not squeeze the soul beasts this time, instead, they were molded.</p>
<p>Be it desolate beast or ancient desolate beast, the soul beasts cried out in agony. After several breaths of time, the huge claws opened up as these soul beasts were released.</p>
<p>Not only did the size of the strength group change, their strength also rose dramatically, there were actually three immemorial soul beasts among them.</p>
<p>These soul beasts were completely loyal to Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, they screeched as they attacked Ying Wu Xie.</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie spat out blood, he felt incredibly stunned.</p>
<p>The method that he used to enslave the soul beasts had been completely erased by Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, he suffered a backlash as a result.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei brought Ying Wu Xie along with her as they quickly retreated.</p>
<p>As purple smoke started to rise, these soul beasts were temporarily trapped, they could only move around in the smoke.</p>
<p>After flying for some time, they two immortals heard a loud sound as the surrounding hundred li started to shake.</p>
<p>The heavenly chasm was broken through by Spectral Soul Demon Venerable!</p>
<p>The two immortals turned pale as they did their best to flee.</p>
<p>But Spectral Soul Demon Venerable was incredibly fast, not long after, he reached them.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's left head roared loudly.</p>
<p>The silhouette of Dang Hun Mountain appeared immediately as it slammed towards the two immortals.</p>
<p>They could not avoid it.</p>
<p>Immortal killer move â€” Purple Will Production!</p>
<p>At the crucial moment, Fairy Zi Wei used a killer move as her body shook, turning into purple smoke that carried Ying Wu Xie as they vanished on the spot.</p>
<p>After a few breaths of time, purple smoke was produced out of nowhere several tens of li away.</p>
<p>The purple smoke turned back into Fairy Zi Wei while Ying Wu Xie fell out from it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, when they encountered the heavenly melody and after Feng Jiu Ge left, Fairy Zi Wei used her method at every set interval of distance traveled.</p>
<p>This method was originally meant to defend against the heavenly melody. But to think that she would have to use it to avoid Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.</p>
<p>After using it, the two immortals managed to survive.</p>
<p>But danger was far from over, the two immortals were still in a perilous situation.</p>
<p>"Bring me along and leave. After using this move, there is a huge drawback, I need to exterminate the large amount of purple will in my mind before I can use it again." Fairy Zi Wei said in an urgent tone.</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie quickly used his soul path method as he flew away with Fairy Zi Wei.</p>
<p>After the two immortals escaped for some time, Ying Wu Xie was shocked to find that his speed was getting slower, any soul path killer move that he used had increasing expenditure.</p>
<p>"I have been struck!"</p>
<p>"It happened when the main body caught me earlier."</p>
<p>"What move is this?"</p>
<p>"It seems to counter all soul path killer moves!"</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie was soon rendered useless.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei had no choice but to take over and escape with Ying Wu Xie.</p>
<p>As Spectral Soul Demon Venerable approached, Fairy Zi Wei had no choice but to use purple will production again to stall for time desperately.</p>
<p>"Let's split up!" Ying Wu Xie gritted his teeth and suggested.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei shook her head, she rejected him without hesitation.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable wanted to kill Ying Wu Xie now. If they split up, Fairy Zi Wei would survive but Ying Wu Xie would definitely not be spared.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei was affected by Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's method and became absolutely loyal to him. Currently, because Spectral Soul Demon Venerable was not in the right state of mind, her loyalty went to Spectral Soul's split soul.</p>
<p>She would do anything to protect Ying Wu Xie, even if it cost her life.</p>
<p>But right at this time, three rank eight Gu Immortals appeared before Fairy Zi Wei.</p>
<p>The left one had a round head and large ears, he wore a loose robe and had an intense qi path aura, he was Heavenly Court's Seven Fiendish Primeval Monarch.</p>
<p>The right one wore a golden hoop on his head, it was Golden Hooped Great Immortal.</p>
<p>The Gu Immortal in the center looked kind and merciful, his eyebrows were very long, reaching his chest, it was one of the three dukes, Duke Mei!</p>
<p>"Fairy Zi Wei is here after all!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Ying Wu Xie is here too."</p>
<p>Duke Mei, Seven Fiendish Primeval Monarch, and Golden Hooped Great Immortal were here on Star Constellation Immortal Venerable's orders to</p>
<p>capture Fairy Zi Wei.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei's immortal aperture was with Heavenly Court, with such an obvious lead, after Star Constellation Immortal Venerable personally made deductions, the three immortals managed to find her.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie's expressions changed.</p>
<p>They were facing danger from both directions.</p>
<p>This was a desperate predicament!</p>
<p>"What do we do?" Ying Wu Xie turned pale.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei frowned deeply, at the moment of crisis, she shouted loudly: "Feng Jiu Ge, I know you are nearby. If you lend us a hand now, we will repay you tenfold in the future!"</p>
<p>"Feng Jiu Geâ€¦ that Heavenly Court traitor?" Golden Hooped Great Immortal frowned.</p>
<p>Seven Fiendish Primeval Monarch snorted coldly: "Good, we will take care of him too."</p>
<p>Duke Mei was about to speak but his brows suddenly rose as his long eyebrows shook intensely: "Oh no, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable is here!"</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's mountain-like body appeared in everyone's vision.</p>
