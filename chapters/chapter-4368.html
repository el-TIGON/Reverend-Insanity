    <h1>Chapter  2314</h1>
    <p>:  I  Reside  in  All  Living  Beings  and  Heaven  and  Earth</p>
<p>Among  the  many  modified  killer  moves,  heavenly  ghost  concealment  was   actually  the  first  to  be  completed.</p>
<p>Since  the  battle  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave  where  Fang  Yuan’s  ghostly   concealment  was  restrained,  Fang  Yuan  had  the  thought  of  modifying  it.</p>
<p>When  his  heaven  path  attainment  level  rose  rapidly  and  had  stealing   heavenly  secret  killer  move,  he  modified  ghostly  concealment  into  heavenly   ghost  concealment.</p>
<p>Ghostly  concealment  killer  move  itself  was  at  rank  nine  so  there  was  not   much  improvement.  But  after  adding  in  heaven  path  Gu  worms,  the   previous  targeted  methods  against  ghostly  concealment  became  ineffective.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  Fang  Yuan’s  body  was  covered  by  a  layer  of  dark  translucent   armor  and  a  pale  white  bone  mask  covered  his  face.</p>
<p>[EMPTY]</p>
<p>It  was  the  manifestation  of  heavenly  ghost  concealment  killer  move.</p>
<p>Different  from  obscured  heavenly  secret,  heavenly  ghost  concealment’s   aura  was  surging  but  it  seemed  to  be  completely  non-existent  to  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  used  many  methods  in  a  row  but  they  were   all  ineffective  towards  Fang  Yuan’s  heavenly  ghost  concealment.</p>
<p>“This  is  a  heaven  path  method  which  shows  Fang  Yuan  has  talents  and   attainment  in  this  path.  Giant  Sun,  are  you  still  going  to  watch  as  Fang  Yuan   gains  these  heaven  path  dream  realms  and  let  him  gain  a  boost  of  strength?”   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  used  this  chance  to  persuade  Giant   Sun  and  strengthen  his  wariness  towards  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  heaved  a  sigh:  ”Fang  Yuan  can  cultivate  all   paths,  once  he  succeeds  in  cultivating  heaven  path,  it  will  form  a  mystical   connection  with  other  paths,  and  his  gains  will  be  inestimable.”</p>
<p>He  was  persuaded  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  increased   the  power  of  his  attacks.</p>
<p>Despite  this,  Fang  Yuan’s  situation  had  turned  better.</p>
<p>He  fought  while  moving  around  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  his  main   target  still  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Seven  Kills  Rainbow!</p>
<p>This  compound  killer  move  was  used  by  Fang  Yuan  repeatedly  to  disturb   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  tried  to  use  chaotic  intent  dispels   dream  killer  move  again  and  again;  sometimes,  she  would  have  just   finished  preparing  the  move  when  Fang  Yuan  caught  up  to  her,  and   sometimes,  she  just  activated  it  but  had  to  cancel  it  to  cope  with  Fang   Yuan’s  attacks.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   attacked  Fang  Yuan  but  Fang  Yuan  stayed  close  to  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  and  dodged  slightly  to  let  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  take   the  attacks.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  took  on  the  attacks  and  became  more   furious,  going  on  full  offensive.  He  saw  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  as  a  thorn  in  his  eyes  but   ignored  Fang  Yuan  who  was  using  him.</p>
<p>After  this  stalemate  lasted  for  a  long  time,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  decisively  changed  the  strategy.  She  made  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  protect  her  while  she  looked  for  a  chance  to  use  her  killer  move.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  expression  shook  slightly.</p>
<p>As  the  battle  continued,  these  two  venerables’  cooperation  became  even   deeper.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  roared  as  he  attacked  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  with  his  countless  giant  arms.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  gave  a  shout  as  he  blocked  in  front  of  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable;  vast  golden  fog  appeared  and  covered   most  of  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  countless  hands  slammed  into  the  golden   fog  and  rummaged  through  them.  The  golden  fog  continued  to  dissipate  but   was  quickly  replenished.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  had  lost  his  senses,  he  should  have  used  a   killer  move  at  this  moment  to  break  through  the  defense  quickly.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  took  advantage  of  this  point.  Even  if   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  used  a  killer  move,  it  might  not  be  the   correct  choice.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  heaved  a  sigh,  he  had  no  choice  but  to  use  another  card.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Arrival  of  Dragon  Snake  with  Dust  Fog  and   Explosive  Soul  Wind!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  pointed  at  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  immediately  wailed  mournfully,  one   hundred  of  his  large  black  arms  suddenly  twisted  and  turned  into  dragons   and  snakes  that  breathed  out  dust  and  dense  fog.  They  then  exploded,   forming  countless  wind  blades  that  destroyed  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable’s  golden  fog.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  coughed  out  a  huge  mouthful  of  blood,  his   defensive  method  was  broken  and  he  suffered  a  backlash.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  also  caught  in  the  move  and  the   chaotic  intent  dispels  dream  that  was  activated  for  a  few  breaths  of  time  was   forced  to  stop.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  howled  and  roared  in  anger  as  he  charged   towards  the  two  venerables.  Fang  Yuan  was  hidden  by  heavenly  ghost   concealment,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  thought  the  two  venerables   had  attacked  instead.</p>
<p>“A  new  killer  move  again!  This  aura…  the  core  is  definitely  the  secluded   domain  of  heaven  and  earth—Luo  Po  Valley.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  grabbed  his  chest  as  he  healed  his  injuries  while  avoiding   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  ghost  hands.</p>
<p>“How  many  killer  moves  of  this  level  did  he  deduce?”  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  gritted  her  teeth,  her  eyes  flickered  with  starlight  as  she   wanted  to  see  through  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  was  still  protected  by  obscured  heavenly  secret,  she  could   not  see  through  him  no  matter  what  she  did.</p>
<p>After  Fang  Yuan  used  this  move,  he  looked  exhausted  and  attacked  less  as   if  he  had  expended  a  lot  of  immortal  essence.</p>
<p>He  could  not  use  Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun   Sound  because  the  rank  seven  Dream  Armor  was  given  to  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>Arrival  of  Dragon  Snake  with  Dust  Fog  and  Explosive  Soul  Wind  was  was   quite  good.</p>
<p>But  because  it  was  a  compound  killer  move,  involving  many  paths  and  Gu   worms,  Fang  Yuan’s  thoughts  were  almost  emptied.  After  all,  he  had  to   continue  maintaining  rank  nine  killer  moves,  heavenly  web  protection  veil   and  heavenly  ghost  concealment.  Fortunately,  rank  nine  obscured  heavenly   secret  killer  move  did  not  need  him  to  pay  attention  to  it  at  all  times.</p>
<p>One  of  the  disadvantages  of  compound  killer  moves  was  that  they  expended   too  much  thoughts.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  made  a  clever  adjustment  but  still   failed.  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  continued  to  explore  the  dream  realm,  providing   constant  benefits  to  Fang  Yuan’s  main  body.</p>
<p>Although  Fang  Yuan’s  attacks  decreased  visibly,  he  used  Arrival  of  Dragon   Snake  with  Dust  Fog  and  Explosive  Soul  Wind  to  repel  and  suppress  the   two  venerables.</p>
<p>Spectral  heaven  had  just  formed,  the  heavenly  wind  qi  wall  was  not  thick   enough,  and  there  were  no  clouds,  the  five  regions’  Gu  Immortals  could   observe  the  battle  easily.</p>
<p>Looking  at  Fang  Yuan  gaining  the  upper  hand,  many  Gu  Immortals  of   Central  Continent  and  Northern  Plains  were  shocked  and  worried.  Some   cursed  Fang  Yuan  for  his  shamelessness;  some  prayed  for  the  righteous   path;  while  some  were  shaken  by  the  demonic  might,  their  face  turned   deathly  pale.</p>
<p>As  for  the  Eastern  Sea  Gu  Immortals,  joy  showed  on  their  faces.</p>
<p>“Damn  it,  if  my  Blood  Sea  was  completed  and  I  had  a  blood  path  killer   move  of  such  a  level,  why  would  I  fear  Fang  Yuan’s  methods?”  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  gritted  his  teeth,  his  stifled  emotions  accumulated  to   the  limit,  finally  making  him  use  his  full  strength!</p>
<p>Luck  path  killer  move  —  I  Reside  in  All  Living  Beings  and  Heaven  and   Earth!</p>
<p>After  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  activated  this  move,  a  giant  pillar  of   light  formed  immediately.  The  light  pillar  was  dazzlingly  golden  and  stood   majestically  between  heaven  and  earth,  it  was  tens  of  thousands  of  feet  tall   and  was  very  thick.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  stood  inside  the  golden  light  pillar,  his  two   hands  and  legs  were  spread  apart  to  the  sides.</p>
<p>His  hair  fluttered,  his  face  distorted  ferociously  as  he  screamed,  veins   bulged  over  his  whole  body  as  if  he  was  in  extreme  pain.</p>
<p>When  the  killer  move  was  activated,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s   attacks  were  all  blocked  by  the  golden  light  pillar.  Fang  Yuan  tried  to  attack   but  found  that  if  he  attacked  the  golden  light  pillar  once,  his  luck  would   shake  and  even  showed  a  sign  of  being  absorbed  by  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  made  a  wise  decision  to  stop  his  action.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  what  did  you  do?”  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  expression  was  unsightly  as  well.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  move  was  too  powerful  and  even   influenced  her.</p>
<p>The  golden  light  pillar  lasted  for  a  short  nine  breaths  of  time  before   stopping  abruptly  and  dissipating.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  body  was  covered  in  a  layer  of  golden   radiance.  His  muscles  were  bulging,  his  golden  hair  fluttered  wildly,  his   entire  body  seemed  to  have  expanded.</p>
<p>He  looked  towards  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.  The  sharp  gaze   made  even  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  narrow  her  eyes.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  mumbled:  ”Star  Constellation,  do  not  worry.   This  move’s  range  covers  the  entire  five  regions,  there  was  no  way  to  avoid   you.”</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  roared,  raising  terrifying  black  fog  that   covered  the  sky.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  shouted  and  breathed  out  fiercely,  forming  a   boundless  hurricane.</p>
<p>The  hurricane  swept  everything,  pushing  aside  the  black  fog,  revealing   hundreds  of  thousands  of  tadpole  like  soul  balls.</p>
<p>The  soul  balls  exploded  around  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  snorted  in  disdain,  that  faint  golden  light  barrier  was   not  even  the  least  bit  damaged.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  countless  hands  attacked,  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  met  the  attacks  with  just  fists  and  kicks.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  ghost  hands  and  dark  arms  were  like  eggs   thrown  at  a  rock.  After  the  collision,  countless  golden  light  specks  drilled   into  the  dark  arms  then  shot  out,  exploding  the  dark  arms.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  began  to  counterattack,  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable  was  immediately  suppressed.  No  matter  how  madly  he   counterattacked,  he  was  attacked  even  more  ruthlessly  by  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  fought  with  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  found  that  Giant   Sun  had  gotten  a  comprehensive  boost  in  offense,  defense,  movement,  and   healing.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  also  suppressed  but  he  gradually  saw  some  details:  ”This   move  is  probably  forcibly  extracting  external  luck  and  enforcing  it  on  his   body.  But  how  large  is  the  range  of  this  move?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  conversation  with  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  just  earlier  was  done  through  voice  transmission.  Fang</p>
<p>Yuan  did  not  know  this  move’s  range  was  so  shocking  large  that  it  covered   the  entire  five  regions!</p>
<p>This  move  had  an  even  deeper  profundity,  it  could  influence  heaven  and   earth  luck,  as  well  as  all  living  beings  luck,  making  all  the  luck  revolve   around  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>The  killer  move  was  called  ’I  reside  in  all  living  beings  and  heaven  and   earth’,  it  truly  lived  up  to  its  name!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  Cooking  Luck  Pot  and  heavenly  web  protection  veil,  his   luck  was  not  influenced  by  this  move.  But  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  defensive  methods  against  luck  path  were  broken  by  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  and  rendered  useless.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  express  anything  for  the   moment.  After  all,  the  urgent  thing  was  to  deal  with  Fang  Yuan  and  kill   Meng  Qiu  Zhen!</p>
<p>After  activating  the  killer  move,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  luck  rose   to  an  unprecedented  level.  Adding  on  his  combat  system,  his  strength   received  a  terrifying  all-rounded  amplification.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  lacking  rationality,  after  attacking   madly  for  a  while,  he  actually  showed  signs  of  defeat.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  not  well-off  either,  but  he  was  still  concentrating  on  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>In  fact,  whether  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  strong  or  not  was  not   crucial.  As  long  as  there  was  no  restriction  from  a  battlefield  killer  move,   Fang  Yuan  was  free  to  advance  and  retreat.</p>
<p>In  Fang  Yuan’s  opinion,  the  key  factor  was  still  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>He  shouted  towards  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  openly  and  not   through  voice  transmission:  ”Star  Constellation,  you  have  a  good  plan  to</p>
<p>make  me  and  Giant  Sun  expend  our  immortal  essence  while  you  stall  for   time.  Can  your  method  even  destroy  my  dream  path  clone?”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sneered:  ”If  that’s  what  you  think,   how  about  letting  me  have  a  try?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  replied  calmly:  ”Star  Constellation,  you  are  still  the  more   skillful  one,  you  saw  through  my  cautious  mind  and  that  I  won’t  dare  to   take  a  risk  in  this  matter.  In  that  case,  I  have  no  choice  but  to  resort  to  other   methods.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   were  immediately  vigilant.</p>
<p>Since  the  start,  the  killer  moves  Fang  Yuan  revealed  were  extremely   shocking  and  powerful.  Especially  his  defensive  method,  the  two   venerables  were  still  unable  to  see  through  it.</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  were  paying  close  attention  for  a  while  but  did  not  see   Fang  Yuan  using  any  more  methods.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  chuckled:  ”Fang  Yuan,  just  a  verbal   threat  does  not  mean  anything.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  laughed  heartily:  ”I  have  used  this  method  long  ago.  Speaking  of   it,  Star  Constellation’s  star  array  calculation  formation  is  really  vast  and   amazing.  Such  a  pity,  it  is  such  a  pity,  it  was  constructed  in  a  hurry  and  is   going  to  be  destroyed  just  as  quickly  as  well.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  immediately  frowned.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time.</p>
<p>Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Outside  of  the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  appeared.</p>
<p>Rumble…</p>
<p>His  qi  path  killer  move  activated.  At  the  next  moment,  heaven  and  earth   shook  as  boundless  qi  surged  and  pressed  down  on  the  star  array  calculation   formation.</p>
