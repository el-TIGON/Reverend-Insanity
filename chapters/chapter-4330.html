    <p>:  Fang  Yuan  Wants  More  Twins</p>
<p>Late  at  night.</p>
<p>Wang  Xiao  Er  looked  at  the  <<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>  as  his  eyes  turned   bloodshot  from  excitement,  his  nose  was  also  blowing  out  steam.</p>
<p>“Foster  father’s  human  path  cultivation  method  is  not  wrong  at  all.  <<The   Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>  is  truly  a  human  path  classic!”</p>
<p>“I’ve  just  noticed  that  in  the  section  regarding  self  Gu,  it  actually  hints  the   different  levels  of  each  Gu  Master  cultivation  rank.  Light  membrane,  water   membrane,  stone  membrane,  and  crystal  membrane!”</p>
<p>“Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  met  the  time  path  Gu,  Year,  Month,  and  Day,  in   the  River  of  Time.  Does  this  mean  that  Gu  Master  cultivation  takes  a  long   time  to  gradually  accumulate  accomplishments?”</p>
<p>“I  am  still  too  ignorant  now,  this  is  all  that  I  can  see.”</p>
<p>“The  human  path  cultivation  method  states  that  the  most  outstanding   cultivators  in  history,the  venerables,  have  all  comprehended  something   from  <<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>.  Thus,  there  are  many  human  path  killer   moves  created  as  their  research  results.”</p>
<p>“Even  though  I  cannot  match  them  now,  I  still  have  an  extraordinary  hope!”</p>
<p>“Self  Gu…”</p>
<p>“It  has  been  hiding  in  my  body  all  along,  the  moment  I  started  my  human   path  cultivation,  I  found  it.  This  must  be  a  human  path  Immortal  Gu!”</p>
<p>“Among  the  various  Gu  worms  mentioned  in  <<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>,   in  my  eyes,  self  Gu  is  the  most  special  and  unique  one.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha,  with  this  Immortal  Gu,  human  path  is  truly  the  most  suitable  path   for  me!”</p>
<p>“It  is  definitely  the  right  choice  to  cultivate  human  path.”</p>
<p>At  almost  the  same  time.</p>
<p>In  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture,  Mini  Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>“Haha.”  Mermaid  Gu  Immortal  Tang  Qiong  could  not  help  but  laugh:  ”It   was  definitely  the  right  choice  for  our  entire  race  to  join  Fang  Yuan  and  live   in  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture.”</p>
<p>Her  excitement  could  not  be  concealed.</p>
<p>There  was  a  total  of  three  merman  female  immortals,  Fang  Yuan  had   brought  them  in  earlier.  After  bringing  a  group  of  mermen  to  settle  down   here,  they  started  to  live  in  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>The  three  merman  female  immortals  had  a  clear  distribution  of  jobs,  Yu  Zi   was  mostly  in  charge  of  completing  missions  and  earning  contribution   points.  Lian  Ke  Xin  was  in  charge  of  external  relations,  she  communicated   with  the  other  races  and  forces.  Tang  Qiong  was  in  charge  of  defending  the   merman  tribe’s  territory.</p>
<p>After  all,  abnormal  situations  often  occurred  in  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture.  The  territory  of  the  various  forces  had  at  least  one  Gu  Immortal   defending  it  at  all  times  for  safety.</p>
<p>Tang  Qiong  had  just  received  orders  from  Fang  Yuan,  there  was  a  piece  of   information  that  was  rather  outstanding.</p>
<p>From  now  on,  Fang  Yuan  would  put  in  more  effort  to  support  the  well- performing  descendants  of  the  various  tribes  and  forces.  He  would  spent  a   huge  sum  to  aid  their  cultivation  and  promote  them  to  become  Gu  Immortal   seeds.</p>
<p>To  achieve  this,  Fang  Yuan  even  gave  orders  to  the  Gu  Immortals  in  charge   of  the  various  factions.</p>
<p>Each  other,  the  respective  forces  had  to  nurture  a  certain  number  of  Gu   Immortal  seeds.</p>
<p>If  they  reached  the  target,  they  would  receive  contribution  points.</p>
<p>Otherwise,  they  would  be  punished.</p>
<p>“Lord  Alliance  Leader  is  not  just  impartial  and  fair,  he  also  has  a  heart  of   benevolence.  He  is  helping  us  variant  humans  to  nurture  more  Gu  Masters   by  investing  such  a  huge  sum  of  resources.  Even  among  the  past   venerables,  none  had  ever  shown  such  love  to  us  variant  humans  like  Lord   Fang  Yuan!  Even  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  only  helped  some  of   our  tribes,  it  cannot  compare  to  Lord  Fang  Yuan.”</p>
<p>Thinking  of  this,  tears  appeared  in  Tang  Qiong’s  eyes.</p>
<p>The  reason  why  Paradise  Earth  Immortal  Venerable  helped  the  variant   humans  was  because  he  could  not  bear  seeing  them  face  the  threat  of   extinction.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  was  different.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  just  give  the  variant  humans  a  fair  and  relatively  safe   environment  to  live  in  without  ostracism,  he  even  gave  them  aid  in  the  form   of  resources  so  that  they  could  grow  stronger.</p>
<p>This  was  an  unprecedented  situation.</p>
<p>Tang  Qiong  had  gone  through  a  lot  of  ordeals  when  she  managed  the   Merman  Imperial  Court,  they  were  ostracized  and  suppressed  by  various   forces.  As  a  merman  Gu  Immortal,  she  had  lived  a  life  of  being  bullied  and   overwhelmed  with  pressure.</p>
<p>Now,  inside  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture,  she  felt  truly  free  and  happy.</p>
<p>The  work  she  did  in  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  was  far  more  tiring   than  being  in  Eastern  Sea,  she  often  had  to  work  her  hardest  and  not  rest  for   more  than  ten  days  in  a  row,  along  with  the  threat  of  her  liver  exploding.</p>
<p>But  now,  Tang  Qiong  was  feeling  increasingly  fond  of  this  place,  she  loved   this  world  and  treasured  this  sea  area!</p>
<p>Because  here,  there  was  fairness  and  equality  that  the  five  regions  lacked.</p>
<p>Because  here,  there  was  abundant  hope.</p>
<p>because  here,  as  long  as  one  worked  hard  and  was  willing  to  undergo   hardship,  they  will  be  rewarded  based  on  effort.</p>
<p>Because  here,  one  could  feel  that  they  were  growing  and  improving  at  an   observable  rate,  their  own  tribe  or  force  was  also  developing  rapidly.</p>
<p>Tang  Qiong’s  divine  sense  Gu  entered  the  information  path  mortal  Gu   again,  she  reread  the  information  that  she  had  already  looked  through   several  times.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  orders  greatly  encouraged  the  procreation  of  the  various   forces.  The  more  children  they  had,  the  more  rewards  they  would  receive.</p>
<p>Regarding  the  increase  in  population,  Fang  Yuan  had  a  clear  direction.</p>
<p>The  vast  amount  of  cultivation  resources  would  be  handed  down  to  the  Gu   Immortals  of  the  various  factions  and  forces  in  the  next  few  days.</p>
<p>Among  which,  there  were  large  quantities  of  relic  Gu,  unprocessed  jade  Gu,   wood  origin  Gu,  water  source  Gu,  man  triumphing  heaven  Gu  and  others.</p>
<p>Relic  Gu  could  raise  the  cultivation  of  a  Gu  Master  by  a  small  realm,  while   precious  mortal  Gu  like  unprocessed  jade  Gu  could  raise  the  Gu  Master’s   aptitude!</p>
<p>In  essence,  they  were  just  carving  a  certain  path’s  dao  marks  on  the  Gu   Master’s  bodies.</p>
<p>Unprocessed  jade  Gu  carved  earth  path  dao  marks,  it  was  suitable  for   raising  the  aptitude  of  rockman  Gu  Masters.</p>
<p>Wood  origin  Gu  suited  minimen,  water  source  Gu  suited  mermen,  while   man  triumphing  heaven  Gu  suited  purebred  humans  without  Gu  Master   aptitude,  it  could  forcefully  awaken  their  aperture.</p>
<p>“With  these  resources,  our  tribe  can  finally  see  hope  in  a  bright  future.”</p>
<p>“There  has  never  been  a  venerable  like  Lord  Fang  Yuan,  he  truly  cares   about  his  people.  No  matter  how  ordinary  or  common  these  people  are,  his   love  is  boundless  like  the  sun  while  soothing  like  the  wind,  enveloping   everyone.”</p>
<p>“He  is  truly  worthy  of  being  Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable!  It  is  my   greatest  fortune  to  be  on  his  side.”</p>
<p>Thinking  of  this,  Tang  Qiong  felt  very  excited  as  tears  flowed  down  her   face.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan,  who  was  idolized  by  Tang  Qiong,  had  just  used  obscured   heavenly  secret  once  again.</p>
<p>It  could  not  be  helped.</p>
<p>The  gains  from  stealing  heavenly  secret  were  too  bountiful.</p>
<p>Even  now,  there  were  still  Gu  Immortals  who  were  returning  from  Eastern   Sea,  Western  Desert,  and  Southern  Border,  bringing  back  cultivation   resources  secretly.</p>
<p>The  most  valuable  things  were  the  information  of  the  five  regions,  Fang   Yuan’s  modified  killer  moves,  and  the  establishment  of  his  combat  system.</p>
<p>Everything  caused  his  luck  to  grow  immensely  again.</p>
<p>Thus,  Fang  Yuan  had  to  activate  obscured  heavenly  secret  again  to  fortify   the  concealment  effect.</p>
<p>During  this  period  of  time,  Fang  Yuan  did  not  refine  his  fourth  rank  nine   Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>On  the  surface,  he  was  refining  Eastern  Sea’s  refinement  path  dao  marks   intermittently,  but  in  secret,  he  was  digesting  the  gains  of  stealing  heavenly   secret  and  deducing  many  things.  As  for  the  truthful  floating  ice,  although  it   was  the  most  important  thing  earlier,  it  was  no  longer  his  focus  now.</p>
<p>The  initial  benefit  of  unsealing  the  truthful  floating  ice  was  already   obtained,  now,  the  gains  had  evidently  fallen.</p>
<p>This  was  reflected  upon  Fang  Yuan’s  own  luck  as  well.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  used  luck  inspection  and  only  managed  to  see  a  portion  of  it,  but   from  this  portion,  he  could  see  many  things  that  were  useful  to  his   deductions.</p>
<p>Everything  involving  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu  was  Fang  Yuan’s   greatest  secret.  This  involved  obscured  heavenly  secret,  stealing  heavenly   secret,  and  others.</p>
<p>Because  of  stealing  heavenly  secret,  Fang  Yuan  started  to  target  those   mortals  in  the  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>He  worked  at  lightning  speed,  after  understanding  the  value  of  these   mortals,  he  decided  to  nurture  them  with  his  full  support.</p>
<p>Tang  Qiong  and  the  rest  did  not  know  the  truth.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  abundant  immortal  materials  in  his  storage,  mortal  materials   were  more  lacking  in  comparison.</p>
<p>The  sovereign  immortal  aperture  itself  produced  a  lot  of  mortal  materials  on   a  large  scale,  but  there  were  a  lot  of  materials  needed  to  nurture  mortals.   The  sovereign  immortal  aperture  had  to  use  treasure  yellow  heaven  to   undergo  various  transactions  and  satisfy  this  need.</p>
<p>The  plan  was  already  established  while  cultivation  resources  were  not  an   issue,  but  Fang  Yuan  wanted  to  make  this  even  better.</p>
<p>He  calculated  and  found  that  he  had  many  methods  that  could  be  used  to   nurture  these  mortal  Gu  Masters.</p>
<p>For  example,  blood  skull  Gu,  bone  flesh  unity  Gu,  and  guts  Gu,  as  well  as   the  rank  one  to  six  version  of  second  aperture  Gu.</p>
<p>Aptitude  was  very  important  to  a  Gu  Master.</p>
<p>Back  then,  Fang  Yuan  had  used  blood  skull  Gu  to  slaughter  his  clan  and   obtained  A  grade  aptitude.</p>
<p>The  A  grade  aptitude  gave  him  immense  help  in  his  future  cultivation   journey.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  A  grade  aptitude  meant  a  higher  chance  at  becoming  a  Gu   Immortal  seed  than  B  or  C  grade  aptitude.  If  one  had  poor  aptitude,  rank   three  or  four  would  be  their  limit,  how  could  they  even  reach  rank  five?</p>
<p>“Blood  skull  Gu’s  ability  to  raise  aptitude  is  even  more  outstanding  than   unprocessed  jade  Gu,  wood  origin  Gu,  water  source  Gu,  and  polished  gold   Gu.  Maybe  I  can  use  blood  skull  Gu  to  undergo  a  massive  slaughter  before   reviving  them  using  Human  Sea  and  slaughtering  them  again.  In  that  case,  I   can  create  a  large  number  of  A  grade  aptitude  Gu  Masters.”</p>
<p>A  terrifying  cultivation  plan  emerged  in  Fang  Yuan’s  mind.</p>
<p>He  thought  of  bone  flesh  unity  Gu.</p>
<p>This  Gu  was  very  useful  to  Fang  Yuan  when  he  was  still  a  Gu  Master.</p>
<p>It  could  help  to  elevate  primeval  essence  for  cultivation,  not  only  could   Fang  Yuan  use  it  to  advance  a  small  realm,  he  could  even  tackle  the   boundaries  to  cross  a  cultivation  rank!</p>
<p>It  was  truly  useful.</p>
<p>“But  to  refine  this  Gu,  I  will  need  twins.”</p>
<p>“This  is  a  little  troublesome.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  not  only  needed  a  few  hundred  bone  flesh  unity  Gu,  he  needed  a   vast  number  of  them  and  scattered  them  across  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture.  In  that  case,  in  the  future,  there  would  be  many  new  Gu  Immortal   seeds.</p>
<p>“I  do  not  have  the  time  to  focus  on  my  current  human  soul  cultivation   method,  my  previous  attempt  has  also  bore  little  fruit.  Thus,  I  can  use  guts   Gu  to  nurture  Gu  Immortal  seeds,  a  stronger  soul  is  very  useful  to  them.”</p>
<p>“As  for  second  aperture  Gu,  it  is  only  icing  on  the  cake.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  would  not  use  rank  six  second  aperture  Immortal  Gu  to  nurture   them,  at  most,  he  would  use  rank  one  to  five  versions  of  them.</p>
<p>Right  now,  second  aperture  Gu  was  confirmed  to  be  a  heaven  path  Gu   worm.</p>
<p>Rank  six  second  aperture  Gu  used  lifespan  Gu  as  the  material,  while   lifespan  Gu  was  the  most  classic  heaven  path  Gu  worm,  it  contained  heaven   path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>Rank  nine  sovereign  immortal  fetus  Gu  used  the  ten  extreme  physiques  as   the  Gu  material,  it  was  ’immortal  fetus’  instead  of  ’immortal  aperture’,  thus</p>
<p>it  was  a  human  path  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  made  a  conclusion,  he  needed  to  amass  Gu  Immortal  seeds  by   first  increasing  the  population.</p>
<p>Whether  they  were  variant  humans  or  humans  did  not  matter.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  intend  to  take  in  external  people,  as  for  Gu  Immortal   seeds,  it  would  be  better  for  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  to  nurture   them,  they  were  more  loyal  after  all.  Variant  humans  were  the  most  loyal  to   him.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  felt  more  assured  with  these  variant  humans.</p>
<p>With  a  higher  population,  the  number  of  Gu  Masters  would  also  rise.  But  to   create  Gu  Immortal  seeds,  one  needed  to  raise  the  Gu  Master’s  aptitude   first.</p>
<p>This  meant  that  mortals  did  not  just  need  to  give  birth  more  often,  they  also   needed  to  create  more  siblings  and  blood-related  kin  for  Fang  Yuan  to   slaughter  in  the  future.</p>
<p>It  would  be  best  if  they  were  twins.</p>
<p>That  way,  while  slaughtering  them,  he  could  also  refine  them  into  bone   flesh  unity  Gu.</p>
<p>“I  need  more  twins…”  Fang  Yuan  thought  about  it  and  muttered:  ”I  need  to   look  for  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.  Among  the  venerables,  he  is  most   skilled  at  having  children!”</p>
