        <p>:  Spectral  Heaven</p>
<p>For  the  three  venerables,  the  shocking  change  to  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  was  only  beneficial  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  let  out  a  breath  of  turbid  air  as  he  sat  cross- legged  with  a  bare  upper  body.</p>
<p>Muscles  could  be  seen  on  his  strong  upper  body,  his  black  chest  hair  gave   off  a  manly  aura.</p>
<p>“My  injuries  have  healed.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  let  out  a  sigh  of   relief.</p>
<p>If  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  continued  to  fight  against  fire  Gu,  the   two  of  them  would  suffer  heavy  injuries,  causing  the  venerables  to  fight   over  them  again.</p>
<p>However,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  injuries  were  more  severe  than   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>If  he  chose  not  to  participate,  he  would  lose  the  opportunity.</p>
<p>But  if  he  went  with  such  injuries,  he  would  be  at  a  disadvantage.</p>
<p>Not  long  ago,  because  of  the  contest  over  light  Gu,  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  face  pressure  from  two  venerables.  He  even  had  to  protect  his</p>
<p>son  Light  Emperor,  causing  him  to  pay  a  huge  price  in  the  end.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  healed  long  ago  while  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  had  only  just  recovered.</p>
<p>Due  to  Feng  Jiu  Ge’s  action,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  became  much   stronger,  forcing  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Great  Love   Immortal  Venerable  to  continue  observing.</p>
<p>Thus,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  benefited  from  this.</p>
<p>The  feeling  was  very  familiar  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  as  it  was   experienced  in  his  previous  life.</p>
<p>He  was  a  luck  path  cultivator  who  explored  the  uncertainty.</p>
<p>The  stronger  he  got,  the  more  advantages  these  uncertain  situations  would   bring  to  him.</p>
<p>After  preparing  for  a  while,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  activated  his   luck  path  investigative  killer  move.</p>
<p>But  this  time,  he  did  not  inspect  the  venerables,  he  checked  himself.</p>
<p>After  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  refined  Heavenly  Court’s   wisdom  path  dao  marks,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  reduced  the  number   of  times  he  inspected  others,  he  started  to  focus  on  himself.</p>
<p>His  luck  was  not  good.</p>
<p>“I  successfully  obtained  rank  nine  light  Gu  but  my  luck  is  still  bad.  Just   what  is  causing  this  bad  luck?”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  frowned.</p>
<p>“Don’t  tell  me  the  reason  is  because  rank  nine  light  Gu  does  not  suit  me?   Furthermore,  it  is  currently  injured  and  is  being  nurtured  inside  Light   Emperor’s  body?”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  guessed.</p>
<p>Rank  nine  light  Gu  was  injured  after  Fang  Yuan  used  his  crippled   refinement  killer  move.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  have  any  method  to  heal  it,  but  Light   Emperor  was  more  specialized  in  light  path,  he  thought  of  the  only  solution   to  this.</p>
<p>That  was  to  use  his  light  body  to  refine  and  nurture  it,  eventually  converting   light  Gu  into  his  vital  Gu,  allowing  him  to  make  use  of  it.  If  this  was  a   normal  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu,  Light  Emperor  would  have  no  way  of   refining  it.</p>
<p>But  light  Gu  was  injured,  its  will  was  heavily  affected,  together  with  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  help,  Light  Emperor  saw  a  chance  of  success.</p>
<p>This  had  its  flaws.</p>
<p>For  a  long  period  of  time,  Light  Emperor  would  lose  all  mobility,  he  even   needed  assistance  in  eating  and  drinking.</p>
<p>Longevity  Heaven  immediately  lost  a  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength   expert.</p>
<p>But  Longevity  Heaven  could  not  do  anything  else.</p>
<p>They  could  not  give  light  Gu  to  Fang  Yuan  and  ask  him  to  repair  it!</p>
<p>This  was  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>While  Fang  Yuan  was  someone  with  no  bottom-line.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  and  Light  Emperor  were  not  stupid  enough  to  ask  Fang  Yuan  for   help.</p>
<p>Looking  at  his  poor  luck,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  sighed  helplessly:   ”If  I  had  obtained  a  rank  nine  luck  path  Immortal  Gu  instead  of  light  Gu,  no   matter  which  luck  path  Gu  it  is,  the  situation  will  be  much  better  now.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  also  very  familiar  with  this  situation.</p>
<p>Although  many  sudden  events  would  often  benefit  him  in  the  end,  most  of   the  time,  they  were  not  things  that  he  needed.</p>
<p>After  all,  this  was  uncertainty,  not  certainty.</p>
<p>Currently,  if  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  a  rank  nine  luck  path   Immortal  Gu,  he  would  be  able  to  create  a  rank  nine  investigative  killer   move  and  find  out  who  was  his  biggest  threat.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  have  a  rank  nine  luck  path  Immortal   Gu,  thus,  when  he  used  an  investigative  killer  move  amplified  by  Longevity   Heaven’s  dao  marks,  he  could  only  see  the  general  trend  of  the  luck.</p>
<p>The  contest  of  three  venerables,  the  rampage  of  the  senseless  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable,  the  interference  of  pseudo  venerables  like  Feng  Jiu  Ge,   as  well  as  the  possible  plotting  of  other  venerables  in  the  background.  All  of   these  types  of  luck  intertwined  together  and  prevented  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  from  seeing  the  specific  details,  he  could  only  see  a  trend.</p>
<p>Rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  was  very  important.</p>
<p>It  signified  a  qualitative  change!</p>
<p>No  matter  how  much  the  amplification  of  dao  marks  became,  it  was  only  a   quantitative  boost.</p>
<p>“I  may  be  the  person  with  the  most  progress  among  the  three  venerables.   Looking  at  this  luck,  it  is  likely  that  the  other  venerables  will  attack  me   because  of  rank  nine  light  Gu.  This  will  cause  their  luck  to  collectively   suppress  mine.”</p>
<p>“Of  course,  there  is  another  possibility  —  someone  surpassed  me!  I’ve   already  lost  my  advantage.  But  if  that  is  the  case,  who  is  the  one  hiding  so   deeply?”</p>
<p>Like  what  Fang  Yuan  did  when  he  thought  about  Feng  Jiu  Ge  and  Heavenly   Court,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  could  only  make  a  guess,  he  could   not  see  the  truth  immediately.</p>
<p>Now,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  to  leave  Longevity  Heaven  and   continue  to  refine  Northern  Plains’  dao  marks.</p>
<p>After  thoroughly  refining  Northern  Plains’  luck  path  dao  marks,  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  would  expand  his  base  from  Longevity  Heaven  to  the   entire  Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>There  were  many  benefits  in  this.</p>
<p>For  example,  if  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  got  attacked  by  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable   again.</p>
<p>He  would  not  need  to  escape  to  Longevity  Heaven,  as  long  as  he  was  inside   Northern  Plains,  he  would  receive  the  amplification  of  power.</p>
<p>Naturally,  the  amplification  would  be  weaker  than  being  in  Longevity   Heaven,  but  it  would  be  enough  to  resist  two  venerables.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  control  over  Northern   Plains  would  increase,  he  would  be  able  to  specially  nurture  Gu  Immortal   descendants.  He  would  not  need  to  worry  about  a  certain  shameless   venerable  who  could  slaughter  the  Huang  Jin  tribes  while  disregarding  his   status,  who  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  have  a  good  way  to  stop.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  understood  that  as  time  dragged  on,  the   venerables  would  continue  to  get  stronger,  and  as  they  progressed,  the   immortal  essence  storage  would  also  become  more  abundant.</p>
<p>At  the  initial  stage  of  development,  the  venerables  lacked  immortal  essence.   At  this  time,  it  would  be  the  best  opportunity  to  refine  the  natural  dao  marks   of  the  world.</p>
<p>If  he  missed  this  opportunity,  it  would  get  tougher.</p>
<p>If  one  was  interrupted  when  refining  natural  dao  marks,  their  progress   would  be  very  small.</p>
<p>If  other  venerables  took  the  lead,  it  would  be  even  worse.</p>
<p>For  example,  if  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  first  refined  the   wisdom  path  dao  marks  of  an  area,  then  her  strength  would  be  much  higher   there.</p>
<p>By  then,  if  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  refine  the  luck  path   dao  marks  of  that  area  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  attacks,   his  best  option  would  be  to  retreat.</p>
<p>Excluding  the  senseless  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  among  the  three   venerables,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  the  clearest  advantage.</p>
<p>He  had  refined  the  most  luck  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>Once  he  refined  all  of  Northern  Plains’  luck  path  dao  marks,  he  would  not   allow  the  other  venerables  to  attempt  the  refinement  here.</p>
<p>Be  it  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  who  would  want  to  refine   Northern  Plains’  wisdom  path  dao  marks  or  Fang  Yuan  who  would  want  to   refine  Northern  Plains’  refinement  path  dao  marks,  they  would  have  to  face   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  all-out  retaliation!</p>
<p>Thus,  now  was  the  best  timing  to  refine  natural  dao  marks.</p>
<p>After  some  time,  the  difficulty  would  rise  greatly.</p>
<p>Other  than  this  reason,  there  was  another  crucial  secret  that  forced  the   venerables  to  quickly  refine  these  dao  marks.</p>
<p>That  was,  one  had  to  completely  refine  all  the  natural  dao  marks  in  the   world  to  maintain  their  supreme  grandmaster  attainment  level!</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  emitted  a  cold  flame  and  slaughtered  the   lifeforms  of  the  two  heavens  while  the  three  venerables  refined  their   respective  natural  dao  marks,  the  five  regions’  Gu  Immortal  world   experienced  temporary  peace  for  the  moment.</p>
<p>Countless  beast  groups  were  escaping  from  the  fused  two  heavens,  landing   in  the  five  regions.</p>
<p>The  super  forces  of  the  five  regions  were  extremely  busy,  they  had  to  move   out  to  defend  their  territories.</p>
<p>As  most  of  the  beast  groups  were  killed  by  the  icy  flame,  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable’s  body  continued  to  expand  as  his  aura  surged  like  the   boundless  sea.</p>
<p>Some  time  later,  his  icy  flame  covered  the  entire  two  heavens.</p>
<p>As  the  three  venerables  and  countless  lifeforms  of  the  five  regions  watched,   the  blue  fire  burned  for  two  days  and  night.</p>
<p>The  white  heaven  and  black  heaven  fragments  in  the  fused  two  heavens   melted  and  joined  together  in  this  blue  fire,  becoming  one  entity.</p>
<p>A  new  heaven  had  appeared!</p>
<p>People  named  it  —  spectral  heaven.</p>
<p>With  immemorial  black  heaven  as  the  foundation  and  white  heaven  being   completely  conquered  and  absorbed,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  who   had  devoured  black  heaven’s  heavenly  spirit  became  the  ruler  of  the  new   heaven.</p>
<p>His  body  was  colossal,  on  par  with  the  previous  sun.</p>
<p>As  the  blue  fire  slowly  extinguished  in  spectral  heaven,  only  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable’s  body  was  left  burning,  even  the  smallest  spark  of  fire   on  his  body  was  tens  of  feet  tall.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  became  the  greatest  source  of  light  in   spectral  heaven,  he  emitted  a  cold  and  chilly  killing  intent  at  all  times,   spreading  his  aura  to  the  five  regions.</p>
<p>This  was  an  unprecedented  change!</p>
<p>Even  in  the  five  hundred  years  of  his  previous  life,  Fang  Yuan  did  not  see   such  a  phenomenon.</p>
<p>The  entire  Gu  cultivation  world’s  environment  was  slowly  changed  by   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>Light  path  was  suppressed  while  dark  path  was  amplified.</p>
<p>Conflicts  and  deaths  arose  all  around  the  world,  most  lifeforms  including   Gu  Masters  could  not  avoid  the  influence  of  the  immense  killing  intent.</p>
<p>Soul  beasts  started  to  appear  all  over  the  world.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  heaven’s  will  also  stabilized.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>A  rank  five  female  Gu  Master  looked  at  spectral  heaven  and  the  majestic   figure  at  the  center  of  it.</p>
<p>She  looked  for  a  while  before  quickly  lowering  her  head,  retracting  her  gaze   entirely.</p>
<p>In  just  this  short  time,  the  killing  intent  in  her  heart  accumulated  to  her   limit,  almost  exceeding  her  endurance.  If  the  killing  intent  overwhelmed   her,  she  would  need  to  perform  a  massacre  to  calm  down.</p>
<p>The  female  Gu  Master  was  very  old,  she  was  ninety-three  years  old.  Her   name  was  Hua  Ben  Ku,  she  had  just  passed  down  the  role  of  clan  leader  in   Eastern  Sea’s  Hua  clan.</p>
<p>She  stared  at  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  intentionally.</p>
<p>After  the  killing  intent  dissipated,  she  started  the  greatest  attempt  of  her  life.</p>
<p>Immortal  ascension!</p>
<p>First  step,  breaking  the  aperture.</p>
<p>Heaven  and  earth  qi  surged  and  formed  grand  calamities  and  tribulations.</p>
<p>Hua  Ben  Ku  had  a  solemn  expression,  although  she  had  the  information   provided  by  Hua  clan,  facing  the  calamities  and  tribulations  now,  she  was   still  shook  internally.</p>
<p>Second  step,  taking  in  qi.</p>
<p>Heaven,  earth,  and  human  qi  surrounded  Hua  Ben  Ku  as  she  focused  to  try   and  balance  all  three  qi.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  natural  inspiration  occurred!</p>
<p>Regarding  the  external  calamities  and  tribulations,  Hua  clan’s  Gu  Immortals   took  action  to  defend  her.</p>
<p>This  was  the  benefit  of  being  a  super  force.</p>
<p>Third  step,  putting  in  the  Gu.</p>
<p>Her  vital  Gu  was  placed  into  the  lump  of  three  qi  as  an  explosion  occurred,   creating  a  new  small  world!</p>
<p>At  this  time,  Hua  Ben  Ku’s  rank  six  immortal  aperture  was  formed,  her   immortal  ascension  succeeded.</p>
<p>A  high  grade  blessed  land.</p>
<p>But  there  was  no  extra  heaven  and  earth  qi  to  refine  a  vital  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>But  Hua  Ben  Ku  was  satisfied.</p>
<p>She  could  barely  calm  down.</p>
<p>During  the  natural  inspiration,  she  had  huge  gains.</p>
<p>Her  lifetime  accumulation  included  her  proudest  killer  move,  it  had   received  a  qualitative  transformation,  becoming  an  immortal  killer  move.</p>
<p>As  long  as  she  used  this  move,  she  could  sit  on  top  of  an  Immortal  Gu   House  and  cry,  it  would  cause  the  target  to  suffer  heavy  damages  and  even   reduce  the  reputation  of  the  Gu  Immortals  inside.</p>
