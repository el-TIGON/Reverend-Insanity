    <p>:  Sword  Qi  Takes  Form</p>
<p>Immortal  battlefield  killer  move  —  Rumor  Cage!</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin  clapped;  in  an  instant,  countless  silver  text  characters   emerged  and  circled  Lin  clan’s  public  blessed  land.</p>
<p>These  characters  were  large  as  horse  carriages  or  small  as  ants,  they  weaved   together  into  a  huge  ball,  enveloping  Heavenly  Court  five  great  Gu   Immortals  and  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder.</p>
<p>“Success.”  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  said  with  excitement,  letting  out  a  breath  of   relief.</p>
<p>A  good  start  was  half  the  success!</p>
<p>The  other  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  also  looked  relieved.</p>
<p>What  they  were  most  worried  about  was  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder   running  away.</p>
<p>They  were  all  rank  eight  Gu  Immortals,  Heavenly  Court  was  fighting  five   versus  one,  but  it  was  very  hard  to  catch  a  rank  eight  Gu  Immortal  who   wanted  to  flee.</p>
<p>With  the  conflict  between  dao  marks,  Gu  Immortals  could  not  easily  show   the  advantage  of  numbers.  These  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  separately   cultivated  wood  path,  information  path,  fire  path,  blood  path,  and   transformation  path  which  conflicted  with  each  other.</p>
<p>“Rumor  cage  really  deserves  the  title  of  the  battlefield  killer  move  with  the   fastest  activation  time.”</p>
<p>“But  I  did  not  expect  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder  to  not  dodge  or  flee.”</p>
<p>“Did  he  see  through  it?”</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  conversed  with  each  other  through   mental  transmission.</p>
<p>They  appeared  grandly  because  they  had  already  arranged  a  temporary   formation  outside  Lin  clan’s  public  blessed  land  headquarters.</p>
<p>Once  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder  escaped  or  flew  out  of  the  public   blessed  land,  the  formation  would  be  triggered  and  attack  him,  reducing  his   speed.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  personally  instructed  them   regarding  the  requirement  of  a  sword  immortal’s  immortal  aperture  and   body.  These  five  Heavenly  Court  members  naturally  made  ample   preparations.</p>
<p>Although  this  formation  did  not  have  much  offensive  power,  it  was   modified  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  herself  to  target  Lin   clan’s  first  supreme  elder’s  escape  methods.</p>
<p>Moreover,  public  blessed  lands  always  had  weaker  defense  than  an   individual’s  blessed  land.</p>
<p>As  an  information  path  expert,  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  had  already  gathered   relevant  information  when  he  moved  around  in  Western  Desert.</p>
<p>Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder  was  already  trapped  in  rumor  cage  battlefield!</p>
<p>Prince  Feng  Xian  gave  a  shout  and  charged  forward.</p>
<p>He  flew  to  the  sky  and  opened  his  mouth  towards  the  palace.</p>
<p>Whoosh—!</p>
<p>Flames  gushed  out  of  his  mouth  and  landed  on  the  ground,  growing  rapidly   into  a  blazing  inferno.</p>
<p>The  palace  was  only  a  mortal  Gu  House,  it  crumbled  apart  rapidly  in  the   inferno.</p>
<p>Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder  was  forced  to  come  out  of  his  seclusion,  he   flew  to  the  sky  and  faced  the  enemies.</p>
<p>Prince  Feng  Xian,  however,  retreated  slowly.</p>
<p>“Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder,  Lin  Jian  Xing,  have  a  taste  of  my  attack!”   Wan  Zi  Hong  chuckled  charmingly  as  she  took  the  place  of  Prince  Feng   Xian.</p>
<p>She  activated  a  wood  path  killer  move.  Instantly,  flower  petals  fluttered  and   covered  the  battlefield,  a  fragrant  smell  spreading  along  with  it.</p>
<p>All  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  held  their  breath.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  had  a  solemn  expression  as  he  pushed  forward  with  his   hands.  In  an  instant,  sword  qi  rampaged  and  formed  into  a  giant  wave.</p>
<p>The  wave  surged  and  billowed,  washing  away  the  poisonous  flower  petals.</p>
<p>Wan  Zi  Hong  disappeared  amidst  the  petals  and  appeared  behind  Lin  Jian   Xing.</p>
<p>She  raised  her  left  little  finger  that  had  a  sharp  purplish  nail  as  she  stabbed   at  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Flower  Thorn  Stab.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  was  struck,  his  figure  paused  before  sword  qi  rose  violently,   sealing  Wan  Zi  Hong  within!</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  his  previously  activated  sword  qi  wave  moved   backwards.</p>
<p>The  surging  giant  wave  drowned  Lin  Jian  Xing  and  Wan  Zi  Hong.</p>
<p>The  other  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  did  not  do  anything  to  avoid   hurting  Wan  Zi  Hong.</p>
<p>The  sword  qi  wave  disappeared  shortly  afterwards,  leaving  only  Lin  Jian   Xing  while  Wan  Zi  Hong  disappeared  once  again.</p>
<p>Flower  petals  fluttered  beside  Prince  Feng  Xian,  turning  into  Wan  Zi  Hong.</p>
<p>Wan  Zi  Hong  was  injured  but  had  a  satisfied  smile  on  her  face:  ”Stall  him,   he  is  struck  by  my  method.  The  longer  time  goes  by,  the  more  thorns  will   grow  in  his  body,  hindering  his  movement  and  even  stabbing  him  to  death.”</p>
<p>Wan  Zi  Hong  made  her  contribution,  she  retreated  and  began  to  heal  her   wounds.</p>
<p>The  other  Heavenly  Court  immortals  continued  to  surround  Lin  Jian  Xing,   not  giving  him  any  time  to  rest.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  made  full  use  of  their  numerical  advantage.</p>
<p>The  silver  characters  that  formed  rumor  cage  began  to  let  out  dazzling  light.   The  dense  light  flowed  like  water,  moving  in  the  air  as  it  gathered  and   swirled.  Next,  from  the  silvery  light,  silver  tigers  emerged.</p>
<p>The  tigers  roared  and  pounced  on  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>It  was  Zhou  Xiong  Xin’s  killer  move  —  Rumors  Become  Tigers.</p>
<p>Prince  Feng  Xian  made  his  move  next;  countless  beautiful  fire  birds   appeared  out  of  thin  air.</p>
<p>The  fire  birds  burned  intensely  while  having  deep  intelligence.  They  formed   into  groups  and  followed  the  tigers.</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  also  made  his  move.</p>
<p>Blood  light  pillars  crashed  down.</p>
<p>Tigers,  fire  birds,  and  blood  pillars  formed  three  waves  of  continuous   attacks!</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  was  surrounded  by  the  attacks  but  he  did  not  evade.</p>
<p>Against  the  incoming  attacks,  he  shouted  grandly  as  sword  qi  surged  out   violently  and  charged  towards  the  tigers.</p>
<p>Sword  qi  condensed  into  vines  beside  the  countless  tigers  and  bound  them.   The  vines  had  countless  sword  path  thorns  that  pierced  deep  into  the  tigers.</p>
<p>Painful  roars  of  tigers  resounded  as  most  of  them  crumbled  apart  like   balloons  being  popped.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  the  fire  birds  entered  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  transferred  his  immortal  essence  as  the  sword  qi  in  the   battlefield  were  replenished,  turning  into  fierce  wind.</p>
<p>The  fierce  wind  killed  all  the  remaining  tigers  and  blew  away  countless  fire   birds,  the  remaining  few  fire  birds  were  unsteady  and  unable  to  gather  into   a  formation  again.</p>
<p>The  blood  light  pillars  smashed  down,  rapidly  suppressing  the  fierce  wind.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  was  forced  to  move  backwards.  After  pulling  some  distance,   he  release  a  large  amount  of  sword  qi.</p>
<p>Sword  qi  turned  into  ice  walls  that  confined  the  blood  light  pillars  and   ground  them  constantly.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  neutralized  three  waves  of  attacks  consecutively,  showing  his   extremely  profound  sword  path  attainment.</p>
<p>Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  did  not  stint  on  her  praise:  ”Lin  clan’s  first  supreme   elder’s  methods  have  a  unique  style  and  are  truly  extraordinary.  I  can’t  wait   anymore,  take  this!”</p>
<p>Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  turned  into  an  immemorial  desolate  beast,  her  roars   were  like  lightning  as  they  shook  even  the  rumor  cage.</p>
<p>Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  clashed  with  Lin  Jian  Xing,  her  attacks  were  filled  with   great  strength,  forcing  Lin  Jian  Xing  to  move  back  again  and  again.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  continued  to  retreat,  unable  to  ward  off  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy’s   charge.</p>
<p>Transformation  path  and  strength  path  Gu  cultivators  had  a  unique   advantage  when  they  were  vanguards  in  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  continued  to  attack  in  turns,   suppressing  Lin  Jian  Xing  since  the  start  of  the  fight.</p>
<p>Although  their  dao  marks  conflicted,  they  had  an  extremely  tacit   coordination.</p>
<p>Their  attacks  were  like  tidal  waves,  continuing  without  stopping.  On  one   hand,  they  suppressed  Lin  Jian  Xing,  not  giving  him  any  chance  or  time  to   study  rumor  cage  battlefield.  On  the  other  hand,  they  were  weakening  and   wearing  him  down,  creating  a  chance  to  capture  him.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  sword  qi  were  exquisite  and  profound,  transforming  into  all   kinds  of  shapes.  His  extraordinary  sword  path  attainment  made  even  the   five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  sigh  in  awe.</p>
<p>But  he  was  just  one  person  after  all,  two  fists  cannot  rival  four  hands,  let   alone  when  Heavenly  Court  had  five  people!</p>
<p>As  time  passed,  the  situation  got  increasingly  disadvantageous  for  Lin  Jian   Xing.</p>
<p>“Strange,  what  method  did  he  use  to  suppress  my  flower  thorn  stab?”  Wan   Zi  Hong  was  inwardly  surprised  at  seeing  Lin  Jian  Xing  moving  so  freely.</p>
<p>Right  at  this  time,  Prince  Feng  Xian  suddenly  used  a  killer  move.</p>
<p>After  Lin  Jian  Xing  was  struck,  grey  flames  burned  all  over  his  body.</p>
<p>The  flames  constantly  produced  fire  birds.  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  momentum   decreased  rapidly  as  his  speed  also  had  an  obvious  reduction.</p>
<p>Seeing  the  chance,  Red  Heart  Traveler  immediately  used  his  killer  move,   blood  sun  seal!</p>
<p>He  coughed  out  a  mouthful  of  blood.</p>
<p>The  fragrant  blood  flew  to  the  air  and  started  rotating.  Like  a  miniature   blood  sun,  it  emitted  endless  blood  red  light  as  it  rushed  towards  Lin  Jian   Xing.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  was  surrounded  by  sword  qi;  at  this  moment,  the  sword  qi   flew  and  turned  into  a  giant  python  that  tried  to  stop  the  blood  sun.</p>
<p>But  this  blood  sun  seemed  to  be  illusory,  it  passed  through  the  obstruction   and  struck  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  chest,  turning  into  a  red  sun  insignia.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  expression  changed  slightly.</p>
<p>The  blood  sun  insignia  showed  its  effect  quickly,  it  formed  into  blood  red   lines.</p>
<p>The  blood  lines  covered  Lin  Jian  Xing,  gradually  forming  a  blood  cocoon.</p>
<p>It  seemed  like  Lin  Jian  Xing  was  about  to  be  captured  alive;  but  at  the  next   moment,  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  body  crumbled  apart,  turning  into  a  powerful   wave  of  sword  qi  that  slipped  out  of  the  blood  cocoon.</p>
<p>After  flying  outside,  these  sword  qi  condensed  back  into  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>“He  can  even  do  this?”</p>
<p>“No,  something  is  not  right!”</p>
<p>“This  is  not  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder.”</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals’  expressions’  changed  as  they  noticed   an  issue  after  seeing  the  situation.</p>
<p>They  shockingly  found  that  the  trapped  Lin  Jian  Xing  was  not  the  Gu   Immortal  himself,  but  only  a  killer  move.</p>
<p>All  along,  the  five  immortals  had  been  toyed  around  until  now  when  they   discovered  it.</p>
<p>“He  is  only  a  lump  of  sword  qi,  no  wonder  my  flower  thorn  stab  had  no   effect.”</p>
<p>“So  that’s  it,  this  was  not  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder,  that’s  why  he  did   not  try  to  evade  when  I  used  rumor  cage.”</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin’s  expression  was  unsightly  as  he  canceled  the  battlefield   killer  move.</p>
<p>The  five  immortals  once  again  appeared  in  Lin  clan’s  public  blessed  land.</p>
<p>The  true  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder  Lin  Jian  Xing  was  standing  in  the  air   with  his  hands  behind  his  back,  showing  a  smile  as  he  looked  at  the  five   immortals:  ”You  finally  came  out.”</p>
<p>“Lin  Jian  Xing,  truly  formidable.  I  wonder  what  the  name  of  this  move  is   called?”  Red  Heart  Traveler  smiled  warmly  as  he  asked.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  nodded  slightly  and  explained:  ”This  move  is  called  sword  qi   takes  form.”</p>
<p>“Sword  qi  takes  form,  truly  a  great  move!”  Prince  Feng  Xian  praised   sincerely.</p>
<p>“After  this  battle,  no  matter  what  happens  to  you,  this  move  will  definitely   be  renowned  throughout  the  five  regions.”  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  commented.</p>
<p>Although  they  were  played,  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  only  looked   grim-faced  but  had  no  loss  in  confidence  or  battle  intent.</p>
<p>In  the  battle  inside  rumor  cage,  they  were  also  suppressed.</p>
<p>After  all,  rumor  cage  created  an  information  path  environment  which   suppressed  four  of  the  Heavenly  Court  immortals.  They  did  not  dare  to  use   all  their  strength  in  fear  of  breaking  the  rumor  cage.</p>
<p>Even  if  it  was  not  destroyed,  if  there  were  great  impacts,  the  battlefield   would  still  be  broken  and  reveal  gaps  from  which  Lin  Jian  Xing  could   escape.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  stretched  out  his  palm  and  showed  several  Immortal  Gu  that   were  bound  by  sword  qi:  ”Heavenly  Court’s  immortal  formation  is  truly   amazing,  it  seemed  to  have  been  modified  to  specifically  target  my  clan’s   public  blessed  land.  Is  this  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   method?”</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  could  not  conceal  their  serious   expressions.</p>
<p>The  formation  they  had  secretly  arranged  outside  of  Lin  clan’s  public   blessed  land  was  already  taken  down  by  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>But  at  the  next  moment,  Lin  Jian  Xing  waved  his  hand,  throwing  the   Immortal  Gu  to  the  Heavenly  Court  immortals:  ”The  Immortal  Gu  have   been  returned  to  you.  This  is  my  clan’s  headquarters,  it  won’t  be  nice  if  we   destroy  it,  let’s  change  the  location  of  our  fight.”</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  quietly  received  the  Immortal  Gu  and   looked  at  each  other.  Finally,  Red  Heart  Traveler  nodded:  ”You  have   unparalleled  grace,  I  am  in  admiration.”</p>
<p>“There  is  a  desolate  area  three  thousand  li  from  here,  please  follow  me.”   Lin  Jian  Xing  flew  out  of  the  blessed  land,  moving  at  a  slow  speed  with  an   indifferent  attitude.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  immortals  followed  closely  after.</p>
