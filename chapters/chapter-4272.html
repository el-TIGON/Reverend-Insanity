        <p>: Star Constellation's Arrangement</p>
<p>Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p>
<p>Intense winds and storms filled Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>The silvery white sky turned dark at this moment.</p>
<p>Within the intense winds, more than ten Immortal Gu Houses were moving around the place, all of Heavenly Court's members were doing their best to salvage the situation.</p>
<p>"The northeast corner has large areas of black smoke, it can corrode the ground and create rotten soil!"</p>
<p>"The immortal graveyard needs to be protected."</p>
<p>"Branded Name Palace is severely damaged, please send reinforcements!"</p>
<p>"Can anyone help me, I can't repair this huge crack in time!!"</p>
<p>The Gu Immortals conversed among each other, this situation had been going on for tens of days, it was getting more dangerous as time passed.</p>
<p>Heavenly Court was filled with danger, and most importantly, its foundation was too immense, it was the number one heaven vein node in the world. During the fusion of the two heavens, Heavenly Court suffered the greatest impact.</p>
<p>Originally, Heavenly Court had a tight defense, but after two invasions, the defensive methods left by Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable and others had either been destroyed or greatly weakened, they were useless in this situation.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Lightning flashed and bolted across half of Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>Eventually, Five Deity Hall blocked it but suffered huge damage in doing it, it fell to the ground, creating a huge pit that emitted dense smoke.</p>
<p>This situation was caused by Heavenly Court's immense foundation.</p>
<p>Even the rank eight Five Deity Hall could barely block such power.</p>
<p>Rain and wind continued unceasingly.</p>
<p>Under such a turbulent situation, in Central Great Hall, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable opened her eyes slowly.</p>
<p>Her star pupils were clear and bright, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable looked through Central Great Hall and observed the entire situation of Heavenly Court in one glance.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"Little Xing, from today onwards, this will be your home." Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable brought back the child Xing Su and said to her.</p>
<p>"Where is this?"</p>
<p>"Heavenly Court." Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable said with deep emotions.</p>
<p>"Heavenly Court…" Xing Su muttered this foreign phrase.</p>
<p>"You can think of it as your home." Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable patted Little Xing Su's head.</p>
<p>"Home?" Xing Su's eyes brightened.</p>
<p>Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable looked far and wide, across the five regions, he seemed to be able to look into the future: "Of course, this is</p>
<p>your home, this will also be home to all of humanity!"</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Deep memories surfaced in Star Constellation Immortal Venerable's mind before fading away quickly.</p>
<p>"Since when has Heavenly Court been in such a pitiful state?"</p>
<p>"Master."</p>
<p>"This is our home, I will defend it till the end. After that…"</p>
<p>"I will wait for your return!"</p>
<p>At the next moment, purple light burst out of Central Great Hall and spread to every corner of Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>"This is?!"</p>
<p>"Star Constellation Immortal Venerable made her move?"</p>
<p>"We are too incapable, we are a burden to Lady Star Constellation Immortal Venerable!"</p>
<p>"No, how can Star Constellation Immortal Venerable act unwisely? It is obvious that she has already refined all of Heavenly Court's wisdom path dao marks."</p>
<p>Once Star Constellation Immortal Venerable took action, the situation immediately changed.</p>
<p>Under the rays of purple light, the raging wind and rain vanished, the intense lightning bolts were dispersed, the crack of heaven and earth mended quickly.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Court Gu Immortals were all shaken internally.</p>
<p>This was the might of a Dao Lord!</p>
<p>Star Constellation Immortal Venerable refined all of the wisdom path dao marks in Heavenly Court, her strength exceeded Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Spectral Soul Demon Venerable completely in this domain.</p>
<p>Right now, even if Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Fang Yuan were to collaborate to attack Heavenly Court, they would not be able to do anything to Star Constellation Immortal Venerable!</p>
<p>"Go! Let's go meet Lady Star Constellation."</p>
<p>Some Immortal Gu Houses landed while some stayed in the air, Gu Immortals streamed out and moved towards Central Great Hall.</p>
<p>Star Constellation Immortal Venerable activated her investigative method.</p>
<p>This investigation had a completely different effect from before.</p>
<p>Using the amplification of Heavenly Court's countless wisdom path dao marks, the investigative killer move's power surged!</p>
<p>"The situation is still within my expectations. Both venerables are still refining natural dao marks, Fang Yuan has little immortal essence and has the slowest progress. Giant Sun Immortal Venerable has the most results, even exceeding me."</p>
<p>Star Constellation Immortal Venerable quickly stopped her investigative method.</p>
<p>She needed to conserve immortal essence now.</p>
<p>It was time for Heavenly Court's immortals to report the various situations.</p>
<p>Due to the fusion of both heavens, Heavenly Court was greatly affected and had huge losses.</p>
<p>"Back then, Profound Literature grotto-heaven faced the problem of crashing stars, thus, Old Immortal Hua Yu did not attack me, I successfully brought back those stars to Central Continent."</p>
<p>Jun Shen Guang said an interesting event that made Star Constellation Immortal Venerable develop a thought.</p>
<p>Human, Imperial Court, poetry, dynasty, Fang Yuan, mermaid immortals, the sovereign immortal aperture…</p>
<p>All sorts of information related to Old Immortal Hua Yu and Profound Literature grotto-heaven flashed past Star Constellation Immortal Venerable's mind.</p>
<p>With the help of Heavenly Court's wisdom path dao marks, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable only expended several hundred thoughts and a meager amount of immortal essence to deduce the result.</p>
<p>"We can make this Profound Literature grotto-heaven betray his alliance!"</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu had deep attachment to the grotto-heaven, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable understood why.</p>
<p>Interrupting Jun Shen Guang was a huge merit but Old Immortal Hua Yu did not do it. This meant that in his heart, Profound Literature grotto-heaven was more important than his status in the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance.</p>
<p>And most importantly, Old Immortal Hua Yu had once opposed Fang Yuan and the variant human alliance, that was the reason why he joined the Righteous Qi Alliance.</p>
<p>But afterwards, Fang Yuan declared himself as Great Love, Eastern Sea's super forces were too meek and immediately joined him, Profound Literature grotto-heaven was forced to follow.</p>
<p>Why did Fang Yuan not annex all these grotto-heavens?</p>
<p>The reason was simple.</p>
<p>The sovereign immortal aperture was not stable, it was unable to expand anymore now!</p>
<p>Non-conflicting dao marks were a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>Long before the battle in Crazed Demon Cave, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had already deduced this huge threat of Fang Yuan's.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan took in many resource points and focused on earth path resource points at first, he was likely constructing an earth path dao vein to stabilize the sovereign immortal aperture.</p>
<p>During the battle in Crazed Demon Cave, Fang Yuan lost many Gu Immortal subordinates.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he took the risk and took in six mermaid immortals, it showed that he was lacking manpower, the sovereign immortal aperture was in a desperate state.</p>
<p>Thus, Fang Yuan could not annex these grotto-heavens.</p>
<p>"He is only skilled at defending against wisdom path deductions, Western Desert's Fang clan's situation is also taking a lot of his energy. The lack of refinement path development is his greatest worry, he cannot bother with Profound Literature grotto-heaven's matter."</p>
<p>Even though Fang Yuan was strong, he had become a venerable through refinement path, not wisdom path.</p>
<p>His wisdom path attainment was not amazing in Star Constellation Immortal Venerable's view.</p>
<p>In the battle in Crazed Demon Cave, the reason why Fang Yuan succeeded was because Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had focused on reviving, she did her best to try to get Crazed Demon Cave's eternal life research results, she also had to guard against Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, it gave Fang Yuan the chance to succeed.</p>
<p>Wisdom path was not skilled at solving impromptu situations, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had too little time to prepare back then.</p>
<p>But as time passed, her wisdom path advantage continued to accumulate.</p>
<p>Ignoring other matters, just the fact that Star Constellation Immortal Venerable refined Heavenly Court's wisdom path dao marks meant that she already had an impregnable position in this contest of three venerables!</p>
<p>"Even if Fang Yuan is not skilled in wisdom path, his wisdom path methods are beyond the ordinary rank eight Gu Immortal. But Profound Literature grotto-heaven's issue has just surfaced, Old Immortal Hua Yu will not report the matter. This is our opportunity."</p>
<p>"If we do not use this chance well and stall for too long, Fang Yuan will notice it."</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable immediately gave orders to send Jun Shen Guang and Qin Ding Ling to Profound Literature grotto-heaven secretly in an attempt to persuade Old Immortal Hua Yu.</p>
<p>"If we can recruit Profound Literature grotto-heaven, can we also do the same to Western Desert's Fang clan?" Wan Zi Hong's will was present, she suggested this.</p>
<p>Duke Tong chuckled and showed an expression of disdain.</p>
<p>Star Constellation Immortal Venerable shook her head and asked Wan Zi Hong's will instead: "Why do you think Wan clan did not choose to join Fang Yuan back then? They knew about Fang clan and Fang Yuan's relationship, why did Western Desert's super forces still agree to create the anti-Fang alliance before our Heavenly Court showed up?"</p>
<p>Wan Zi Hong's will shook slightly, she seemed to realize something.</p>
<p>With the fusion of two heavens and contest of three venerables, the five regions' political situation was completely chaotic, the factors involved were not just strength or benefits, there was also the people's will.</p>
<p>The heart of the people was a very intricate thing, it was hard to assess at times, but also extremely easy to decipher at times.</p>
<p>Back then, Heavenly Court was created and received resounding support from everyone, the greatest reason was the people's will.</p>
<p>Righteous path and demonic path, if one only classified them according to fixed criteria set by the major players, it would be too shallow.</p>
<p>Heavenly Court could recruit otherworldly demons, they could recruit demonic path Gu Immortals like Wan Zi Hong, this was because they could be said to be upholding justice, they were giving demons a second chance to turn over a new leaf, this was their great benevolence.</p>
<p>But if Heavenly Court recruited Fang clan, they would lose everyone's support.</p>
<p>Why did Heavenly Court support Wan clan, what was the reason? All along, what was the motto of Heavenly Court? What stance did they take?</p>
<p>If they recruited Fang clan which had fallen into the demonic path entirely, then what difference would Heavenly Court have when compared to those who only pursued benefits?</p>
<p>In these situations, if Heavenly Court wavered in their stance and went for petty gains, their reputation would take the biggest hit. In fact, even the ten great ancient sects of Central Continent would start having doubts.</p>
<p>Especially at this sensitive juncture, Fang clan was supported by Fang Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan plotted secretly and made Fang clan attack Wan clan, it was because he knew that his reputation and popularity would not be accepted easily just because he declared himself as Great Love.</p>
<p>Eastern Sea's super forces joined him merely out of fear.</p>
<p>Wu Yong made transactions with Fang Yuan for benefits. Not long after, Wu Yong also made transactions with Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>If Heavenly Court did this, Fang Yuan might become overjoyed.</p>
<p>And this suggestion could only be brought up by someone like Wan Zi Hong, she was a former demonic path member after all, other Heavenly Court members had not mentioned it.</p>
<p>Was it because they could not?</p>
<p>Of course not!</p>
<p>"The righteous path has the advantage in Western Desert's conflict. The only worry is if Fang clan goes all-in and sells all their resource points to Fang Yuan." Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had a thought.</p>
<p>She was the number one person in wisdom path, she had long expected such a situation, thus, when she sent the members, she chose Zhou Xiong Xin.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiong Xin was an information path Gu Immortal, he was skilled at finding clues.</p>
<p>Once Fang clan abandoned everything and left, Zhou Xiong Xin would collect the relevant information and let Star Constellation Immortal Venerable make deductions on them.</p>
<p>They had the duty of eradicating evil forces.</p>
<p>Fang clan had to be exterminated!</p>
<p>After Star Constellation Immortal Venerable refined all of Heavenly Court's wisdom path dao marks, she had to rest and accumulate immortal essence now before she could start her next move.</p>
<p>"For the short period ahead, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's threat is even greater than Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Heaven Refining Demon Venerable."</p>
<p>"It is time to send people to search for Fairy Zi Wei."</p>
<p>Star Constellation Immortal Venerable arranged everything in meticulous and orderly fashion.</p>
