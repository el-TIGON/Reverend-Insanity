    <h1>Chapter  2301</h1>
    <p>:  Heaven  Path  Dream  Realm</p>
<p>The  truth  was,  Fang  Yuan  had  no  choice  but  to  use  endless  trouble  killer   move.</p>
<p>If  he  had  to  undergo  tribulation,  he  would  need  to  place  the  sovereign   immortal  aperture  in  the  five  regions  and  draw  in  heaven  and  earth  qi.  At   that  time,  heaven’s  will  would  control  them  and  form  tribulations.</p>
<p>The  calamities  and  tribulations  were  not  scary,  Fang  Yuan  was  confident  of   dealing  with  them.</p>
<p>But  during  his  tribulation,  the  other  venerables  would  definitely  come  to   probe  and  suppress  him.</p>
<p>But  at  that  time,  his  sovereign  immortal  aperture  would  not  be  movable,   because  of  the  deep  involvement  of  heaven’s  will,  if  the  venerables  attacked   too  fiercely,  obscured  heavenly  secret  might  not  be  able  to  conceal  Fang   Yuan  anymore.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  would  be  exposed.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   must  also  be  using  methods  to  delay  their  tribulations.”  Fang  Yuan  was</p>
<p>certain  about  this.</p>
<p>In  this  contest  of  three  venerables,  nobody  wanted  to  be  the  first  to  undergo   tribulation.  Whoever  did  that  would  expose  a  flaw  first  and  face   suppression.</p>
<p>If  they  were  targeted  too  badly,  it  would  be  hard  to  catch  up  to  the  other   venerables  anymore.</p>
<p>There  would  be  a  danger  of  dying.</p>
<p>This  was  true  for  grand  tribulations  and  myriad  tribulations,  while  the   chaotic  disaster  was  a  huge  flaw  of  the  venerables!</p>
<p>“After  using  endless  trouble  this  time,  I  am  not  far  from  the  next  chaotic   disaster.”  Fang  Yuan  thought.</p>
<p>Venerables  faced  a  grand  tribulation  every  ten  years,  a  myriad  tribulation   every  fifty  years,  and  a  chaotic  disaster  every  one  hundred  years.</p>
<p>That  was  to  say,  after  eight  grand  tribulations  and  one  myriad  tribulation,   they  would  face  one  chaotic  disaster.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  already  used  endless  trouble  many  times,  he  was  two  grand   tribulations  away  from  the  chaotic  disaster.</p>
<p>In  this  aspect,  Fang  Yuan  was  the  venerable  with  the  biggest  problem.</p>
<p>“Oh?”  After  endless  trouble  was  used  successfully,  Fang  Yuan’s  expression   changed  slightly.</p>
<p>Although  endless  trouble  succeeded  like  many  of  the  previous  attempts,   there  was  a  difference  now.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  felt  a  faint  sense  of  hunger.</p>
<p>After  gaining  sovereign  immortal  body,  it  needed  to  consume  food  or  it   would  get  hungry.  But  this  hunger  was  not  like  the  normal  feeling  of  hunger   —  it  originated  from  his  origin!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  expression  gradually  turned  solemn.</p>
<p>He  knew  why.</p>
<p>This  was  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  desire  to  eat  a  venerable   immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Sovereign  immortal  body  originally  had  this  flaw,  or  rather,  weakness.  But   in  Fang  Yuan’s  estimations,  there  was  still  some  time  left  after  becoming   rank  nine.</p>
<p>To  think  that  he  was  already  feeling  faint  hunger  that  could  not  be  ignored.</p>
<p>This  was  much  earlier  than  he  had  expected.</p>
<p>“Is  it  because  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  has  grown  too  big  and   annexed  too  many  grotto-heavens,  since  even  now,  I  am  still  bringing  in   resource  points?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  vaguely  felt  that  this  was  the  truth.</p>
<p>He  had  developed  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  too  well.</p>
<p>The  greatest  weakness  and  also  advantage  of  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture  were  the  non-conflicting  dao  marks.</p>
<p>But  because  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  development  was  too  good,   and  because  of  the  non-conflicting  dao  marks,  its  foundation  was  unstable.</p>
<p>“But  before,  even  with  rank  eight  cultivation  level,  I  have  never  felt  such   hunger.”</p>
<p>“After  becoming  venerable,  this  feeling  emerged,  what  is  the  reason?”</p>
<p>“No  matter  what,  the  four  paths  of  refinement  path,  food  path,  heaven  path,   and  human  path  hold  the  possibility  of  resolving  sovereign  immortal  body’s   problem  of  requiring  food.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  analyzed  continuously  in  his  mind.</p>
<p>He  was  most  skilled  in  refinement  path,  there  was  no  need  to  explain  it.  As   long  as  he  raised  the  sovereign  immortal  body  to  rank  ten,  the  problem   would  be  resolved.</p>
<p>Food  path  could  replenish  the  expenditure  and  promote  growth.  Children   need  to  eat  food  to  have  enough  nourishment  to  grow.  Sovereign  immortal   body  held  the  same  logic.</p>
<p>As  for  human  path  and  heaven  path…</p>
<p>Sovereign  immortal  fetus  Gu  was  made  using  the  ten  extreme  physiques  as   the  main  materials,  it  was  a  pure  human  path  Gu  worm.  But  in  the  end,  it   transformed  into  sovereign  immortal  body  that  had  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture.  In  this  aspect,  it  contained  heaven  path  profundity.</p>
<p>And  the  effect  of  having  non-conflicting  dao  marks  was  also  part  of  heaven   path.</p>
<p>Now,  the  problem  was  that  these  four  paths  were  theoretically  capable  of   resolving  the  issue  of  sovereign  immortal  body’s  food  requirement.  The   issue  was  that  Fang  Yuan  did  not  know  which  path  was  the  most  feasible   and  possible  one.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  most  about  refinement  path,  he  needed  to  modify  and   innovate  to  resolve  sovereign  immortal  body’s  issue.</p>
<p>Food  path  and  human  path  were  not  developed  yet.</p>
<p>Heaven  path  was  uncertain  too,  there  might  not  be  any  solution  available,   Fang  Yuan  might  have  to  create  his  own  method.  After  all,  rank  nine   sovereign  immortal  fetus  Gu  had  already  broken  the  balance  of  the</p>
<p>Heavenly  Dao,  it  was  a  grand  feat  achieved  by  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>It  was  very  difficult  for  Fang  Yuan  to  resolve  the  root  issue  of  sovereign   immortal  body’s  food  requirement.</p>
<p>Even  though  he  was  a  venerable,  he  was  not  confident  of  doing  it,  he   needed  to  invest  resources  and  effort  to  make  deductions.  After  all,  rank   nine  sovereign  immortal  fetus  Gu  was  an  unprecedented  creation.</p>
<p>Other  than  solving  the  root  cause,  there  were  also  methods  to  alleviate  it.</p>
<p>That  was  to  satisfy  the  hunger  and  devour  a  venerable  immortal  aperture!</p>
<p>This  difficulty  was  quite  high.</p>
<p>It  meant  that  Fang  Yuan  would  have  to  defeat  a  venerable.</p>
<p>If  there  was  just  one  venerable,  Fang  Yuan  might  have  an  easier  time.  The   issue  was  that  many  venerables  existed  now,  if  one  person  was  too   outstanding,  there  would  be  a  huge  chain  reaction.  Fang  Yuan  did  not  have   the  strength  to  suppress  all  the  venerables  at  once,  if  he  was  exposed,  the   situation  would  be  troublesome  for  him.</p>
<p>“But  if  I  can  annex  a  venerable’s  aperture,  there  is  also  a  good  aspect  in  that   I  can  skip  tribulations.”</p>
<p>“This  means  that  if  I  plan  properly,  I  will  not  need  to  take  a  risk  and   undergo  the  chaotic  disaster,  I  can  directly  skip  this  huge  problem!”</p>
<p>Thinking  of  this,  Fang  Yuan  was  moved  internally.</p>
<p>He  thought  of  Paradise  Earth.</p>
<p>Paradise  Earth  was  killed  by  him  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  his  soul   dissipated  but  his  immortal  body  and  aperture  remained.</p>
<p>Because  he  cultivated  heaven  path,  the  immortal  aperture  was  very  stable   unlike  other  paths.  Thus,  Fang  Yuan  was  able  to  preserve  it  until  now.</p>
<p>Although  Paradise  Earth’s  immortal  aperture  was  only  rank  eight,  it  was   merely  a  step  away  from  venerable  level.</p>
<p>Paradise  Earth’s  immortal  body  had  enough  heaven  path  dao  marks,  he  only   lacked  heaven  path  attainment  level  to  become  a  heaven  path  venerable.</p>
<p>That  was  to  say,  as  long  as  Fang  Yuan  used  split  soul  to  take  over  Paradise   Earth’s  immortal  aperture  and  body,  he  would  gain  a  heaven  path  clone.</p>
<p>“A  heaven  path  clone  with  rank  eight  cultivation  level,  but  it  is  only  a  step   away  from  venerable  level.”  Fang  Yuan  was  moved.</p>
<p>If  his  heaven  path  attainment  level  could  reach  supreme  grandmaster,  he   would  immediately  be  able  to  create  a  heaven  path  venerable  clone!</p>
<p>At  that  time,  be  it  to  fight  against  other  venerables  or  to  annex  this   venerable  immortal  aperture,  it  would  be  very  useful  to  Fang  Yuan!</p>
<p>“It  is  a  pity  there  is  only  a  bit  of  truthful  floating  ice  left,  I’ve  used  most  of   it.  The  remaining  part  cannot  allow  me  to  become  a  supreme  grandmaster  in   heaven  path.”</p>
<p>Spectral  heaven.</p>
<p>“Zi  Wei,  you  can’t  escape.”  Duke  Tong  quickly  shortened  the  distance   between  him  and  Fairy  Zi  Wei.</p>
<p>Fairy  Zi  Wei’s  expression  was  quite  pale,  Ying  Wu  Xie  who  was  in  her   arms  said:  ”Let  me  block  them,  you  should  escape.”</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  countless  methods,  Duke  Tong  and  the  rest  were   revived  Gu  Immortal  seniors,  even  as  a  wisdom  path  great  expert,  Fairy  Zi   Wei  could  not  hide  for  long.</p>
<p>Most  importantly,  the  environment  in  spectral  heaven  changed,  the  previous   black-white  overturning  clouds  had  completely  vanished,  Fairy  Zi  Wei</p>
<p>could  not  use  them  anymore.  Thus,  even  though  she  could  escape  from   them  temporarily,  she  would  be  found  by  them  after  a  short</p>
<p>period  of  time  and  they  would  catch  up  in  no  time.</p>
<p>Seeing  that  Duke  Tong  was  reaching  her  again,  Fairy  Zi  Wei  felt  despair  in   her  heart.</p>
<p>It  was  not  easy  to  last  this  long,  she  was  already  at  her  wits’  end.</p>
<p>“Feng  Jiu  Ge,  when  are  you  going  to  take  action?”  Fairy  Zi  Wei  shouted.</p>
<p>Duke  Tong  snickered  in  disdain:  ”Zi  Wei,  how  long  are  you  going  to  keep   up  this  act?”</p>
<p>Feng  Jiu  Ge  did  not  appear  after  all,  he  was  not  Shadow  Sect’s  savior.</p>
<p>But  another  change  occurred.</p>
<p>A  pink  beast  growled  and  charged  at  them  while  covered  in  an  illusory  halo.</p>
<p>“What  is  this?!”  Duke  Tong  stared  with  wide  eyes.</p>
<p>“Dream  realm?”  Fairy  Zi  Wei  gritted  her  teeth,  she  flew  towards  the  pink   beast  and  got  devoured  in  one  mouthful  without  dodging  it.</p>
<p>After  devouring  Fairy  Zi  Wei  and  Ying  Wu  Xie,  the  beast  was  not  satisfied,   it  charged  towards  Duke  Tong  instead  of  stopping.</p>
<p>Facing  the  intense  dream  path  aura,  Duke  Tong  had  no  choice  but  to  dodge.</p>
<p>“Dream  realm?  Why  is  it  in  a  beast  form?!”  Duke  Tong  was  helpless,  he   could  not  enter  or  leave  the  dream  realm  at  will.</p>
<p>Moreover,  this  dream  realm  was  different  from  what  was  described  in  their   intel,  it  could  move  around  and  hunt  prey.</p>
<p>“Compared  to  the  dream  realm  that  we  are  used  to,  this  current  one  fits  the   description  in  <<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>,  what  is  going  on?”</p>
<p>Duke  Tong  was  bewildered.</p>
<p>While  reporting  to  Heavenly  Court,  he  chased  after  the  dream  realm.</p>
<p>When  the  dream  realm  attacked,  he  retreated,  after  it  left,  he  followed  it   from  afar.</p>
<p>Afterwards,  he  discovered  even  more  dream  realms.</p>
<p>These  dream  realms  had  various  forms  but  they  were  all  beasts.</p>
<p>“Dream  realms  that  have  gathered  into  a  group!  This  is  a  new   transformation  in  spectral  heaven!!”  Duke  Tong  was  increasingly   suspicious,  he  watched  as  the  dream  realm  that  devoured  Fairy  Zi  Wei  and   Ying  Wu  Xie  mixed  into  the  group.</p>
<p>Duke  Tong’s  investigative  methods  were  ineffective  on  dream  realms,  and   because  they  were  constantly  changing  forms,  he  soon  lost  all  traces  of  that   particular  dream  realm,  he  could  not  tell  which  one  was  it.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  soon  received  Duke  Tong’s   information.</p>
<p>She  sighed  as  her  gaze  flickered  with  uncertainty:  ”Heaven  path  dream   realms…  they  finally  appeared.  One  of  them  even  devoured  Fairy  Zi  Wei   and  Ying  Wu  Xie,  this  is  all  the  ploy  of  heaven’s  will.”</p>
<p>In  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  plan,  Ying  Wu  Xie  was  crucial.   If  she  could  capture  it,  she  would  have  the  best  pawn  to  use  against  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>But  now,  although  Duke  Tong  chased  after  him,  heaven  path  dream  realms   appeared  at  the  crucial  moment  and  destroyed  her  plan.</p>
<p>“In  that  case…”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  immediately  used   her  backup  plan,  she  contacted  and  gave  orders  to  Fairy  Maiden  Soul.</p>
<p>This  soul  path  great  expert  received  the  orders  and  immediately  showed  an   incredulous  expression.</p>
<p>Afterwards,  she  returned  to  Heavenly  Court  and  entered  the  treasury,  taking   out  a  soul.</p>
<p>Next,  she  placed  this  soul  into  her  immortal  aperture  and  used  her  method   to  nourish  the  soul  while  altering  its  memories.</p>
<p>Time  passed  quickly  in  the  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Several  days  later  in  the  immortal  aperture,  Fairy  Maiden  Soul’s   modification  was  completed.</p>
<p>She  immediately  contacted  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable:  ”Bo   Qing’s  soul  has  already  been  modified.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  received  the  news  and  nodded.</p>
<p>Now,  all  they  needed  was  the  body  of  a  sword  path  Gu  Immortal.</p>
