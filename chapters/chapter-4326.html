    <div id="content-container">
        <p>:  Mental  Domain</p>
<p>Inside  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Within  the  secret  room,  an  entire  circle  of  Fang  Yuan  were  sitting.</p>
<p>Or  more  accurately,  a  large  number  of  Fang  Yuan’s  clones.</p>
<p>This  cultivation  secret  room  was  huge,  Fang  Yuan’s  clones  were  all  newly   formed  using  human  path  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>Among  them,  the  Gu  Master  level  ones  were  doctor,  pill  refiner,  constable,   and  craftsman.  There  were  also  rank  six  Gu  Immortal  level  ones  like   shadow  puppet,  talented  girl,  soldier,  sergeant,  musician,  thief,  farmer,   dancer,  and  blacksmith.</p>
<p>Indeed,  the  human  path  research  results  that  the  ten  children  of  human  path   gained  from  entering  the  derivation  formation  were  all  obtained  by  Fang   Yuan.</p>
<p>After  that,  he  rushed  to  refine  all  these  Gu!</p>
<p>As  long  as  he  had  the  recipe,  with  Fang  Yuan’s  refinement  path  attainment,   refining  these  low  ranked  Immortal  Gu  was  very  easy.</p>
<p>This  resulted  in  the  ten  children  of  human  path  failing  to  create  their  vital   immortal  Gu  during  their  immortal  ascension.</p>
<p>During  this  period  of  time,  Fang  Yuan’s  clones  had  been  in  closed   cultivation,  comprehending  human  path  and  having  their  respective   insights.</p>
<p>“Although  these  clones  are  low  in  rank,  there  are  exceptional  aspects  when   compared  to  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  method.”</p>
<p>“For  example,  they  only  need  a  small  investment  to  create.  Spectral  Soul’s   Shadow  Sect  clones  needed  to  cultivate  themselves  and  start  from  zero.  But   these  clones  could  instantly  gain  Gu  master  or  Gu  Immortal  level  strength   by  just  using  human  path  Gu  worms.”</p>
<p>The  clones  formed  from  human  path  Gu  worms  had  apertures  and  immortal   apertures  for  Gu  Masters  and  Gu  Immortals  respectively.</p>
<p>But  be  it  aperture  or  immortal  essence,  neither  could  produce  primeval   essence  or  immortal  essence,  they  could  only  store  essence.</p>
<p>The  human  path  clones  were  also  unable  to  cultivate  to  increase  their   strength.</p>
<p>The  rank  of  the  Gu  worm  decided  the  strength  of  the  clone.</p>
<p>But  the  human  path  clones  would  retain  the  main  body’s  attainment  levels.</p>
<p>The  human  path  clones  mainly  cultivated  human  path  with  other  paths  on   the  side.  For  example,  musician  clone  cultivated  human  path  with  sound   path  on  the  side.  Farmer  clone  cultivated  human  path  with  wood  path  and   earth  path  on  the  side.  Shadow  puppet  clone  cultivated  human  path  with   transformation  path  and  shadow  path  on  the  side…</p>
<p>All  in  all,  these  clones  were  not  useful  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>They  were  too  weak,  even  the  highest  ranked  one  was  only  rank  six.</p>
<p>The  thing  that  both  Fang  Yuan  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   agreed  with  was  that  pill  refiner  clone  had  the  greatest  value.</p>
<p>This  clone  cultivated  human  path  with  refinement  path  and  pill  path  on  the   side.</p>
<p>Although  there  were  only  rank  one  to  five  pill  refiner  Gu  Masters,  they   would  create  a  terrifying  impact  on  the  entire  Gu  Master  world!</p>
<p>If  Fang  Yuan’s  subordinates  did  not  undergo  immortal  ascension  at  this   time,  these  human  path  clones  might  still  be  useful.  Now,  they  were  of  little   value  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>They  were  even  an  important  evidence  that  could  expose  obscured  heavenly   secret!</p>
<p>Thinking  about  it,  Fang  Yuan  turned  these  human  path  clones  back  into   their  respective  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>They  were  similar  to  Fang  Yuan’s  sovereign  immortal  body  but  quite   different.</p>
<p>They  could  interchange  between  Gu  worm  and  human  forms,  but  Fang   Yuan’s  sovereign  immortal  body  was  fixed  at  human  form  with  the   requirement  to  eat  the  Gu  worm’s  food.</p>
<p>But  in  any  case,  a  normal  person  needed  to  eat  at  set  intervals  as  well.</p>
<p>“I’ll  leave  thief  Gu  behind.”  Thinking  so,  Fang  Yuan  willed  at  the  next   moment  as  most  of  the  Gu  worms  in  the  secret  room  self-detonated!</p>
<p>Central  Continent.</p>
<p>In  the  deepest  part  of  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  inspecting  a  secluded  domain  of   heaven  and  earth  that  was  inside.</p>
<p>This  secluded  domain  looked  like  a  cage  or  a  lantern,  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  had  used  it  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave  to  fight  against  the</p>
<p>other  venerables.</p>
<p>This  was  the  wisdom  path  secluded  domain  —  Mental  Domain!</p>
<p>It  was  recorded  in  <<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  placed  Mental  Domain  in  the  star   array  calculation  formation  and  used  the  power  of  the  formation  to  secretly   absorb  emotions.</p>
<p>All  sorts  of  negative  emotions  in  the  Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient   sects  were  absorbed  into  the  Mental  Domain.</p>
<p>With  this  method,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  managed  to  leave   only  positive  emotions  in  the  countless  lifeforms  of  Central  Continent   towards  Heavenly  Court  and  the  ten  great  ancient  sects.</p>
<p>This  caused  Central  Continent’s  unity  to  rise  to  a  new  level!</p>
<p>“Mental  Domain  needs  to  store  emotions,  the  more  emotions  there  are,  the   stronger  this  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth  becomes.  But  it  needs  to   be  controlled  too.”</p>
<p>“If  there  are  too  much  emotions  stored,  the  Mental  Domain  will  instead  go   too  far  and  have  a  reverse  effect.”</p>
<p>“Like  what  is  recorded  in  <<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>,  it  would  be  best  to   have  calm  Gu  and  fortitude  Gu  to  suppress  Mental  Domain.”</p>
<p>“It  is  a  pity  that  I  only  have  calm  Gu  but  not  fortitude  Gu.  Thus,  there  is  an   obvious  limit  to  the  amount  of  emotions  the  Mental  Domain  can  store.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  needed  to  be  careful  when  activating   it,  she  could  not  afford  to  expose  this  to  the  other  venerables  and  end  up   with  trouble.</p>
<p>At  that  time,  even  someone  who  lacked  immortal  essence  like  Fang  Yuan   would  want  to  extort  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>This  was  the  trick  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  played  when   creating  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  she  managed  to  hide  it  from   the  two  venerables.  After  all,  they  could  only  see  the  general  information  of   the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>After  her  inspection,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  received  some   good  news.</p>
<p>“Oh?  Among  the  ten  children  of  human  path,  someone  has  already  refined   musician  Gu  to  an  Immortal  Gu?”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“It  seems  that  the  failed  attempts  from  earlier  was  due  to  the  obstruction  of   heaven’s  will.  The  refinement  of  Immortal  Gu  during  the  ascension   tribulation  is  essentially  using  heaven’s  will  to  help  one  refine  Gu.”</p>
<p>“Heaven’s  will  was  unwilling  to  help  likely  because  these  are  human  path   Gu  worms.”</p>
<p>“But  afterwards,  the  refinement  attempt  done  by  a  person  succeeded!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  put  her  heart  at  ease.</p>
<p>Earlier,  when  she  found  that  the  ten  children  of  human  path  had  all  failed,   she  felt  suspicious.</p>
<p>The  possibilities  included  having  traitors  in  Heavenly  Court,  a  problem  with   the  derivation  formation,  the  hidden  methods  of  the  other  venerables  in   Heavenly  Court,  or  even  because  information  was  leaked  by  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>After  learning  of  this  success,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   suspicions  were  mostly  lifted.</p>
<p>Half  a  day  later,  the  first  batch  of  Gu  Immortals  chosen  from  Central   Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects  gathered  within  the  star  array  calculation   formation.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Endless  Learning!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  activated  this  killer  move.</p>
<p>The  killer  move  had  a  light-blue  radiance  that  spread  within  the  star  array   calculation  formation.</p>
<p>In  a  certain  space  within  the  formation,  the  Gu  Immortals  were  ready.</p>
<p>“It’s  coming.”  Someone  muttered  with  an  excited  expression.</p>
<p>Everyone  was  stirred.</p>
<p>Soon,  the  immortals’  expressions  turned  solemn  as  they  were  immersed  in   the  indescribable  profundity  of  the  Great  Dao.</p>
<p>With  the  effect  of  the  killer  move,  the  immortals’  cultivation  paths’   attainment  level  rose  gradually!</p>
<p>As  time  passed,  after  reaching  their  limit,  some  Gu  Immortals  started  to   develop  hallucinations.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  the  star  array  calculation  formation  would  activate  and  send   these  Gu  Immortals  to  another  part  of  the  formation  to  rest.</p>
<p>Endless  learning  was  a  human  path  killing  intent,  it  used  Book  Mountain   and  learning  Gu  as  the  cores,  allowing  the  Gu  cultivator  to  produce  true   meaning  and  absorb  it  to  raise  their  attainment  levels.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  used  this  move  in  Crazed   Demon  Cave  before,  she  was  now  using  it  on  the  Central  Continent’s  ten   great  ancient  sects’  Gu  Immortals.  Her  intention  to  nurture  them  was  more   sincere  now.</p>
<p>The  gains  of  the  Gu  Immortals  would  depend  on  their  own  talent,  aptitude,   comprehension,  and  personal  experiences.</p>
<p>“Unimaginable,  to  think  that  there  is  such  a  method  in  the  world  to  directly   raise  attainment  level!”</p>
<p>“This  move  was  used  by  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   personally,  of  course  it  is  amazing,  she  can  achieve  the  impossible!”</p>
<p>“Rumor  has  it  that  dream  realms  can  raise  the  Gu  cultivator’s  attainment   level.  In  my  opinion,  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  method   has  completely  surpassed  the  dangerous  method  of  dream  path.”</p>
<p>“Dream  realm  explorations  are  very  dangerous  but  the  attainment  level   gained  can  potentially  be  endless.  As  for  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  human  path  killing  move,  our  gains  will  depend  on  ourselves.  It   can  only  help  us  to  produce  true  meaning,  after  using  it  once,  we  will  need   to  accumulate  a  lot  of  experience  and  foundation,  otherwise,  we  will  not   have  much  gains  next  time!”</p>
<p>The  immortals  slowly  break  out  of  the  hallucinations  and  woke  up  as  they   started  conversing.</p>
<p>Soon,  the  immortals  flew  out  of  the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Three  stayed  and  did  not  leave  yet.</p>
<p>Among  them,  there  was  Heaven’s  Envy  Manor’s  Gu  Immortal,  Tan  Ku,  he   went  to  find  Ancient  Soul  Sect’s  Yang  Feng  and  Spirit  Butterfly  Valley’s   Dian  Pu.</p>
<p>After  some  discussion,  Tan  Ku  used  his  own  Immortal  Gu  to  exchange  for   Yang  Feng’s  resources,  he  then  used  Yang  Feng’s  immortal  materials  to   exchange  for  Dian  Pu’s  other  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>After  the  transaction,  all  three  side  got  what  they  wanted,  they  were   satisfied.</p>
<p>“Thanks  to  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  it  can  understand  what  we   need  and  help  us  to  undergo  optimal  transactions.  Otherwise,  how  can  we   know  of  each  other’s  needs  so  clearly?”  Dian  Pu  sighed.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  all  three  immortals  benefited  from  the  star  array   calculation  formation,  they  understood  its  usefulness.</p>
<p>Ever  since  the  star  array  calculation  formation  collected  information  of  the   Gu  Immortals,  such  situations  became  more  common  among  the  Central   Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects’  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Thus,  even  the  Gu  Immortals  of  the  smaller  sects  were  interested,  they   wanted  to  report  their  own  information  to  the  star  array  calculation   formation.</p>
<p>The  formation  had  the  ability  to  distribute  overall  resources  more  efficiently   in  Central  Continent  by  just  focusing  on  transaction  between  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Undeniably,  this  would  promote  the  growth  of  Central  Continent  and  raise   its  overall  strength.</p>
<p>The  three  immortals  did  not  have  a  close  relationship  before,  but  after  the   transaction,  they  became  closer.</p>
<p>On  the  way  back,  they  talked  about  the  recently  popular  topic  among   Central  Continent’s  Gu  Masters,  human  path.</p>
<p>During  this  period  of  time,  human  path  cultivation  had  become  a  rising   trend  for  the  lower  rank  Gu  Masters  in  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>This  was  clearly  backed  by  the  ten  great  ancient  sects  who  were  tasked  by   Heavenly  Court  to  support  this  trend.</p>
<p>“It  seems  that  Heavenly  Court  has  decided  to  develop  human  path.”</p>
<p>“That’s  right,  our  sects  chose  the  ten  children  of  human  path  who  have  all   become  Gu  Immortals  now.  Heavenly  Court  has  the  top  tier  research  results   of  human  path,  now  is  the  time  for  them  to  promote  it  widely.”</p>
<p>“I  think  that  it  is  too  rushed,  but  since  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  made  such  a  decision,  there  must  be  a  flaw  in  my  logic.”</p>
<p>“It  is  a  pity  that  our  path  is  already  set,  converting  to  human  path  is  too   costly.”</p>
<p>“Friend  Tan  Ku,  you  are  smiling.  Do  you  have  a  solution  to  this?”</p>
<p>“I  only  made  the  Gu  Immortal  seeds  in  my  immortal  aperture  cultivate   human  path.”</p>
<p>“Haha,  I  did  that  too.”</p>
<p>Central  Continent’s  Gu  Immortals  were  gradually  feeling  the  advantages  of   the  star  array  calculation  formation,  they  also  showed  a  consensus  regarding   the  prospects  of  human  path.</p>
<p>However,  Tan  Ku  still  did  not  know  this  now.</p>
<p>Although  his  action  was  the  same  as  any  other  Gu  Immortals,  one  small   character  who  he  supported  would  rise  to  become  a  legend  in  the  future!</p>
