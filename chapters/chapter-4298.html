        <p>:  Retaliation  of  Three  Venerables’  Luck</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Sword  Tongue  Dragon  Soul.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  body  shook  slightly  as  a  hundred  evil  dragons  appeared  around   him  instantly.</p>
<p>The  evil  dragons  danced  and  paraded,  they  gathered  into  a  group  and   encircled  You  Tian  Guang.</p>
<p>He  had  used  this  compound  killer  move  before,  if  he  used  it  against  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  there  would  be  a  risk  of  it  getting   unraveled  or  countered.  But  now,  Fang  Yuan  used  it  to  trap  You  Tian   Guang.</p>
<p>The  evil  dragons  attacked  You  Tian  Guang  from  all  directions,  they  bit,   swung  their  tails,  stabbed  with  their  horns,  or  used  their  claws,  some  even   shot  out  sharp  sword  qi  with  their  tongues…</p>
<p>In  this  dangerous  situation,  You  Tian  Guang  erupted  with  the  strength  of  a   legendary  immemorial  beast.</p>
<p>It  waved  its  hands  and  its  body  moved  like  lightning,  the  horn  on  its  head   was  extremely  sharp,  in  just  a  whole,  three  evil  dragons  were  sliced  in  half.</p>
<p>After  a  lot  of  effort,  it  managed  to  kill  several  evil  dragons,  but  dragon  souls   came  out  of  them  to  modify  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>The  more  evil  dragons  that  died,  the  more  dragon  souls  that  gathered,  the   battlefield  was  filled  with  soul  path  dao  marks  that  made  the  dragon  souls   even  stronger!</p>
<p>The  situation  was  increasingly  dangerous,  You  Tian  Guang  tried  to  charge   out  from  different  directions  as  it  fought  a  bloody  battle,  but  it  could  not   break  free  from  the  evil  dragons.</p>
<p>Sensing  the  danger  that  its  host  was  in,  the  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu  in  You   Tian  Guang’s  body  burst  out  with  its  power  again.</p>
<p>A  piercing  light  shone  on  the  entire  battlefield,  it  seemingly  tried  to  escape   with  You  Tian  Guang  by  turning  it  into  a  ray  of  light.</p>
<p>Earlier,  when  Fang  Yuan  and  Star  Constellation  chased  after  You  Tian   Guang,  this  was  the  move  that  caused  them  to  fail  in  capturing  it  multiple   times.</p>
<p>But  now,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  already  prepared.</p>
<p>Starlight  specks  flew  out  and  surrounded  You  Tian  Guang’s  body.</p>
<p>The  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu  burst  out  with  power  but  the  starlight  specks   suppressed  most  of  its  strength,  it  failed  to  escape  with  You  Tian  Guang  but   caused  it  to  suffer  huge  injuries  instead.</p>
<p>Rank  nine  light  Gu  was  a  wild  Gu,  it  was  not  in  sync  with  You  Tian  Guang,   thus,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  found  its  weakness.</p>
<p>But  this  was  normal.</p>
<p>Even  though  You  Tian  Guang  and  light  Gu  had  been  together  for  a  long   time,  it  had  spent  most  of  the  time  sleeping.</p>
<p>Now  that  it  was  awake,  with  just  rank  eight  cultivation  level,  it  could  not   refine  a  wild  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Back  then,  even  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  who  had  become   venerable  spent  a  hundred  years  to  refine  the  wild  rank  nine  wisdom  Gu.</p>
<p>As  for  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  he  attempted  to  refine  rank  nine  love   Gu  and  failed  in  the  end.</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang’s  blood  spewed  out  like  a  geyser,  it  fell  into  despair.</p>
<p>The  enemies  were  too  powerful,  it  had  suffered  huge  injuries  that  caused  it   to  become  even  slower  than  before.</p>
<p>But  it  still  struggled.</p>
<p>For  the  meager  hope  in  its  heart  that  wanted  to  escape,  it  resisted!</p>
<p>“Don’t  come  here,  don’t  come  here…”  Light  Emperor  hid  in  the  black   cloud  and  watched  as  You  Tian  Guang  approached  him,  he  became   flustered  and  anxious.</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  coincidentally  escape  in  the  direction  that  led  to  him.</p>
<p>“Is  this  my  so-called  fortuitous  encounter?”  Light  Emperor  sudden  shook  as   he  recalled  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  words.</p>
<p>He  immediately  understood  that  his  fortuitous  encounter  was  rank  nine  light   Gu,  but…</p>
<p>“Father,  this  is  too  much!”  Light  Emperor  glanced  at  Fang  Yuan  and  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  he  did  not  even  dare  to  look  at  them  for   more  than  a  moment  in  fear  that  they  would  notice  him.</p>
<p>Light  Emperor’s  bald  head  almost  wanted  to  hide  in  his  chest.</p>
<p>All  along,  his  body  had  been  emitting  light,  but  now,  he  kept  the  light   concealed  as  only  a  thin  halo  was  left.</p>
<p>But  You  Tian  Guang  still  came  in  his  direction  at  full  speed.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  Light  Emperor  could  feel  nothing  but  hatred  towards  this   huge  fortuitous  encounter!</p>
<p>He  did  not  know  that  Fang  Yuan  was  feeling  the  same.</p>
<p>“The  timing  is  not  right.  If  this  happened  after  I  refined  heavenly  secret  Gu,   I  will  be  able  to  use  my  full  strength  to  capture  the  wild  light  Gu!”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  attacked  and  chased  You  Tian  Guang  while  secretly  refining   heavenly  secret  Gu.</p>
<p>Thankfully,  he  spent  a  lot  of  effort  to  modify  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu’s   recipe.</p>
<p>Using  Four  Elements  Square  Regret  Blood  Refinement  Pool,  and  with  the   help  of  the  hairy  man  Gu  Immortals,  heavenly  secret  Gu’s  refinement   proceeded  without  a  hitch.</p>
<p>“The  following  is  the  most  difficult  part.  But  at  this  time,  I  need  to  chase   after  that  rank  nine  light  Gu!  Sigh…”  Fang  Yuan  sighed  to  himself.</p>
<p>He  did  not  feel  much  attraction  to  rank  nine  light  Gu.</p>
<p>Rank  nine  Heavenly  secret  Gu  had  far  greater  value  to  Fang  Yuan  than  light   Gu.</p>
<p>But  the  situation  had  progressed  to  this  stage,  Fang  Yuan  had  to  show  that   he  was  determined  to  take  the  Immortal  Gu  for  himself.</p>
<p>“Fate  Gu  has  been  destroyed,  this  situation  should  have  been  caused  by  the   contest  of  luck  between  the  other  three  venerables  and  myself.”  Fang  Yuan   had  a  vague  comprehension.</p>
<p>Once  Fang  Yuan  refined  heavenly  secret  Gu  successfully,  his  strength   would  grow  immensely,  the  benefits  would  not  just  be  limited  to  obscured   heavenly  secret,  there  were  other  advantages  too.</p>
<p>But  in  that  case,  Fang  Yuan’s  advantage  would  be  too  huge.</p>
<p>Precisely  so,  the  other  three  venerables  were  threatened  by  Fang  Yuan.   Although  they  did  not  notice  it,  their  luck  had  already  started  to  retaliate.</p>
<p>The  luck  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable,  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  mixed  together  and   attacked  Fang  Yuan  in  unison.</p>
<p>Precisely  so,  at  the  crucial  moment  of  refining  heavenly  secret  Gu,  Fang   Yuan  faced  such  a  huge  difficulty  and  uncertainty.</p>
<p>“In  this  situation  with  the  existence  of  four  venerables  and  contest  of  three   venerables,  the  current  timing  is  a  crucial  turning  point!  Sovereign  immortal   aperture,  rank  nine  Heavenly  Essence  Treasure  Imperial  Lotus,  rank  nine   advance  refinement  Immortal  Gu,  my  cultivation  of  refinement  path  and   heaven  path,  as  well  as  other  elements  like  obscured  heavenly  secret  have   given  me  a  huge  advantage  that  is  deeply  hidden,  my  luck  is  comparable  to   all  three  of  them  together.”</p>
<p>This  comparison  was  under  the  situation  where  the  three  venerables  did  not   know  the  truth.  because  they  canceled  out  a  portion  of  each  other’s  luck,   this  allowed  Fang  Yuan  to  match  them  evenly.</p>
<p>Once  the  venerables  understood  the  situation  and  found  out  the  truth,  they   would  cooperate  with  each  other  and  cause  this  cancellation  to  be  smaller.   By  then,  their  collective  luck  would  surpass  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>“If  I  get  past  this  difficulty  without  the  three  of  them  finding  out  the  truth,   after  gaining  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu,  my  luck  will  be  higher   than  the  three  of  them  combined.  After  a  qualitative  change,  when  I  refine   other  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  in  the  future,  I  will  no  longer  face  such  a   hurdle.”</p>
<p>After  making  an  analysis,  Fang  Yuan  understood  that  this  was  a  crucial   fight.</p>
<p>If  it  were  to  be  said  that  becoming  a  refinement  path  venerable  was  the   foundation  to  resisting  the  other  venerables.</p>
<p>Then  after  refining  rank  nine  Heavenly  Essence  Treasure  Imperial  Lotus,   Fang  Yuan  shortened  the  gap  between  himself  and  the  venerables.</p>
<p>After  refining  rank  nine  advance  refinement  Gu,  the  gap  was  shortened   even  further,  it  even  deepened  Fang  Yuan’s  advantage  in  refinement  path.</p>
<p>And  now,  if  he  refined  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu,  it  would  create  the   turning  point  in  the  contest  of  three  venerables!</p>
<p>Once  this  crucial  point  was  passed,  Fang  Yuan  would  surpass  the  other   venerables,  he  would  have  a  true  advantage  against  them.</p>
<p>As  star  fog  appeared,  You  Tian  Guang’s  path  was  completely  blocked.</p>
<p>Evidently,  this  was  an  incomplete  battlefield  killer  move.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  use  this  battlefield  killer   move  to  trap  You  Tian  Guang  and  the  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu  before   dealing  with  them.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  not  seen  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  use  a   battlefield  killer  move  before,  he  was  hesitant  now.</p>
<p>Should  he  try  to  destroy  it  now?</p>
<p>It  was  not  something  that  he  could  not  tolerate  for  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  to  obtain  the  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu.</p>
<p>It  was  very  difficult  to  refine  rank  nine  light  Gu,  while  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  did  not  cultivate  light  path.  After  getting  it,  during  the   period  that  she  tries  to  refine  it,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   positive  luck  would  fall  greatly.</p>
<p>From  the  perspective  of  the  situation,  in  order  to  prevent  Fang  Yuan  from   ruining  her  plan,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  would  definitely   give  up  more  benefits  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>This  was  very  beneficial  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Thinking  of  this,  Fang  Yuan  activated  his  killer  move.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Seven  Kills  Rainbow!</p>
<p>Metal  path’s  yellow  light,  wood  path’s  jade-green  light,  water  path’s  light   blue  hue,  fire  path’s  red  light,  earth  path’s  brown  light,  wind  path’s  green   radiance,  and  lightning  path’s  deep  blue  light;  seven  lights  from  these  seven   paths  mixed  together  and  shot  forward  in  a  drill  shape  towards  You  Tian   Guang.</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  immediately  sensed  fatal  danger.</p>
<p>If  he  was  hit  by  this  move,  it  would  definitely  perish,  alongside  the  rank   nine  light  Gu  in  its  body.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  guarded  against  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>“What  are  you  trying  to  do?!”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  called   out  as  starlight  flew  out,  forming  a  veil  made  of  stardust,  it  was  like  a  wall   between  heaven  and  earth,  blocking  Fang  Yuan’s  seven  kills  rainbow.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  mind  was  also  running  out  of  thoughts,  he  had  to  refine   heavenly  secret  Gu  while  maintaining  his  defensive  killer  moves  and   movement  killer  moves.  Earlier,  he  even  had  to  use  an  offensive  killer  move   like  seven  kills  rainbow  forcefully.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  snorted  coldly  but  did  not  show  any  weakness:  ”Friend  Star   Constellation,  even  if  you  want  to  get  rank  nine  light  Gu,  do  you  think  it   will  be  this  easy?”</p>
<p>On  the  outside,  Fang  Yuan  showed  an  attitude  of  relentlessness,  he  was   prepared  to  fight  to  the  end.  But  the  truth  was,  he  had  already  made  up  his   mind  to  destroy  this  wild  light  Gu,  if  that  failed,  so  be  it  if  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  got  the  Gu.</p>
<p>In  Fang  Yuan’s  condition,  he  could  not  obtain  the  Gu  even  if  he  tried.  The   priority  was  to  destroy  rank  nine  light  Gu,  followed  by  letting  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  have  it,  the  worst  case  was  for  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  to  get  it.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   were  not  light  path  Gu  cultivators,  but  if  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  got   this  rank  nine  light  Gu,  his  own  luck  would  grow  explosively.</p>
<p>That  was  extremely  useful  for  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  with  his   attainment  in  luck  path,  he  would  become  much  stronger.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sighed:  ”Friend  Fang  Yuan,  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable  has  not  arrived  yet,  are  we  really  going  to  fight   now?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  smiled  coldly:  ”Why  not?  If  I  wait  any  further,  aren’t  you  going   to  obtain  the  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  already?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  went  into  a  standoff.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  targeted  the  incomplete  star  fog  battlefield  killer  move   occasionally,  while  attacking  You  Tian  Guang  and  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  respectively  at  other  times.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  worthy  of  being  a  wisdom  path   venerable,  her  mind  was  filled  with  thoughts,  she  managed  to  handle  all  the   various  aspects  and  keep  her  control  over  the  situation.</p>
<p>Although  the  situation  was  in  a  deadlock,  it  was  clearly  tilting  towards  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>During  the  contest  of  the  venerables,  You  Tian  Guang  had  already  gotten   severely  injured,  rank  nine  light  Gu  tried  many  attempts  to  escape  with  it   but  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  blocked  it  each  time.</p>
<p>Seeing  that  the  star  fog  was  about  to  gather  into  a  complete  battlefield  killer   move,  Light  Emperor  could  not  wait  anymore.</p>
<p>“Dazzle  them!”  He  attacked  abruptly  using  his  strongest  method.</p>
<p>Blinding  white  light  filled  the  entire  battlefield,  Light  Emperor  used  all  his   effort  to  create  a  small  opening  in  the  star  fog.</p>
<p>“Escape,  escape,  escape!”  Light  Emperor  desperately  charged  towards  the   exit,  he  did  not  have  the  energy  to  care  about  the  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>He  had  waited  for  a  long  time  before  Fang  Yuan  weakened  the  star  fog   battlefield  sufficiently  without  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   having  the  time  to  replenish  it.  Thus,  he  could  make  an  opening  in  this   battlefield.</p>
<p>If  he  waited  any  longer  and  the  star  fog  battlefield  formed  completely,  he   would  have  no  chance  of  escaping  anymore.</p>
