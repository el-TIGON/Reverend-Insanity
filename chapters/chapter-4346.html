    <h1>Chapter  2303</h1>
    <p>:  Besieging  Lin  clan’s  First  Supreme  Elder</p>
<p>Back  in  Western  Desert.</p>
<p>Lin  Lun  Zhou  suddenly  opened  his  eyes.</p>
<p>The  immortal  formation  sounded  an  alarm;  someone  had  intruded!</p>
<p>“Such  guts,  you  dare  to  invade  my  Lin  clan’s  Skeleton  Mountain.”  Lin  Lun   Zhou  was  surprised  and  furious,  checking  immediately.</p>
<p>He  saw  that  an  Immortal  Gu  House  was  violently  colliding  with  the   defensive  formation.</p>
<p>“Inquiry  Dock!  Fang  clan!!”  Lin  Lun  Zhou’s  expression  turned  serious  as   he  sent  request  for  reinforcements  to  Lin  clan  while  fully  activating  the   defensive  formation.</p>
<p>Ever  since  Fang  clan  started  the  commotion,  Lin  clan  had  reinforced  the   immortal  formations  in  many  resource  points,  and  almost  all  the  formations   had  the  ability  to  transport  people.</p>
<p>So,  Lin  Lun  Zhou  was  not  panicked.</p>
<p>As  his  battle  intent  rose,  he  frowned:  ”Since  Fang  clan  attacked  after   remaining  in  hiding  for  so  many  days,  they  definitely  made  sufficient   preparations.  I  definitely  am  not  Fang  clan’s  match  by  myself,  but  I  can  use   this  immortal  formation  to  stall  for  time.  Once  the  anti-Fang  alliance  army   arrives,  Fang  clan  will  definitely  suffer  consequences.”</p>
<p>“Of  course,  if  the  situation  turns  bad,  I  will  immediately  use  the  formation   to  get  out…  What?!”</p>
<p>Lin  Lun  Zhou  had  been  controlling  the  formation  when  his  eyes  suddenly   opened  wide  and  panic  filled  him.</p>
<p>To  his  horror,  he  found  that  the  formation  was  restricted.</p>
<p>Although  the  formation  could  still  operate,  its  transportation  effect  was   nullified.</p>
<p>“They  targeted  this  after  all!!”  Lin  Lun  Zhou  clenched  his  teeth  as  he   forcibly  calmed  himself,  thinking  of  a  way  to  get  out  of  this  predicament.</p>
<p>He  felt  that  not  all  hope  was  lost.</p>
<p>He  was  a  rank  seven  bone  path  Gu  Immortal  defending  Lin  clan’s  Skeleton   Mountain.  This  was  a  bone  path  resource  point  and  he  had  a  huge  territorial   advantage  here.</p>
<p>Moreover,  Lin  Lun  Zhou  was  stationed  here  all  year  round,  he  knew  this   place  like  the  back  of  his  hand.</p>
<p>After  thinking  for  a  while,  Lin  Lun  Zhou  arranged  a  portion  of  his  will  with   some  immortal  essence  while  he  left  quietly.</p>
<p>The  defensive  formation  was  still  defending  with  all  its  strength  under  the   control  of  his  will.</p>
<p>Fang  clan’s  Immortal  Gu  House  collided  again,  creating  thunderous  sounds.</p>
<p>Lin  Lun  Zhou’s  will  was  shrinking  rapidly,  but  it  could  still  last  for  some   time.</p>
<p>Lin  Lun  Zhou  entered  the  depths  of  Skeleton  Mountain.</p>
<p>The  rocks  on  Skeleton  Mountain  were  dark  and  let  out  soul  smoke  from   time  to  time.  Once  in  a  while,  the  mountain  rocks  would  produce  a</p>
<p>skeleton.  Some  skeletons  were  like  humans,  some  had  animal  shapes,  there   were  countless  possibilities.</p>
<p>Besides  these  bone  armors,  dark  mist  crows  flew  above  Skeleton  Mountain   and  fed  on  the  soul  smoke.</p>
<p>Fang  clan’s  Immortal  Gu  House’s  attack  shook  the  whole  Skeleton   Mountain.</p>
<p>The  countless  skeletons  that  were  among  the  rocks  were  originally   motionless.  But  as  the  mountain  started  shaking,  these  skeletons  propped   themselves  up  and  ran  wildly  on  the  mountain.</p>
<p>The  skeletons  collided  and  killed  each  other,  creating  chaos.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  Lin  Lun  Zhou  activated  a  killer  move.  He  transformed  into   a  large  mammoth  skeleton  and  started  running  on  the  mountain.</p>
<p>He  was  mixed  in  among  the  countless  skeletons,  becoming  inconspicuous.</p>
<p>But  not  long  later,  threads  of  water  vapor  bound  him.</p>
<p>“Friend  of  Lin  clan,  why  be  in  a  hurry  to  leave?”  Shortly  after,  a  voice   entered  Lin  Lun  Zhou’s  ears.</p>
<p>Lin  Lun  Zhou  immediately  fell  into  despair:  ”Rank  eight  Gu  Immortal?  You   are  not  from  Fang  clan!”</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  the  water  vapor  ropes  moved  and  bound  Lin  Lun  Zhou   tightly.</p>
<p>Lin  Lun  Zhou  struggled  madly,  but  soon,  his  vision  turned  black  as  he  lost   his  consciousness.</p>
<p>News  of  Fang  clan’s  attack  on  Lin  clan’s  peripheral  resource  point  Skeleton   Mountain  soon  reached  Lin  clan’s  headquarters.</p>
<p>Shortly  after,  Lin  clan  contacted  the  anti-Fang  alliance.</p>
<p>By  the  time  the  anti-Fang  alliance  reached  Skeleton  Mountain,  there  were   only  ruins.  The  whole  Skeleton  Mountain  was  gone.</p>
<p>“This  is  indeed  Fang  clan’s  style!”</p>
<p>“Lin  Lun  Zhou  was  the  Gu  Immortal  stationed  here,  he  cultivates  bone  path   and  is  quite  strong,  I  did  not  expect  him  to  go  missing  as  well.”</p>
<p>“Sigh,  it  bodes  ill  for  him.”</p>
<p>“Fang  clan  came  to  make  trouble  again,  their  sins  are  unforgivable!  Once   we  catch  them,  we  will  rip  their  skin  and  cut  their  tendons  to  relieve  our   hatred!!”</p>
<p>Just  as  the  anti-Fang  alliance  members  were  cursing  Fang  clan,  another   astonishing  news  arrived.</p>
<p>Dong  clan’s  peripheral  territory,  Dragon  Roar  Volcano,  was  also  attacked  by   Fang  clan.</p>
<p>Dragon  Roar  Volcano  was  a  fire  path  resource  point,  but  whenever  the   volcano  erupts,  it  would  produce  dragon  roars;  at  that  time,  a  sizable   amount  of  sound  path  resources  could  be  harvested.</p>
<p>When  athe  nti-Fang  alliance  reached  Dragon  Roar  Volcano’s  site,  they  did   not  see  any  volcano.</p>
<p>“Heavens,  even  the  underground  magma  has  been  taken  away.”</p>
<p>“It  seems  like  Fang  clan  wants  to  make  a  big  commotion  this  time!”</p>
<p>“They  went  into  hiding  for  some  time;  it  was  probably  to  exchange  for   Immortal  Gu  or  killer  moves  from  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable,  and   increase  their  strength.  Otherwise,  would  they  dare  come  out?”</p>
<p>“That’s  right.  Be  it  Dragon  Roar  Volcano  or  Skeleton  Mountain,  they  are   important  areas  that  Fang  clan  would  not  have  rashly  invaded  before.  But   now,  both  were  attacked  and  taken,  Fang  clan’s  strength  has  definitely   increased  greatly.”</p>
<p>“The  important  thing  is,  will  Fang  clan  continue  their  actions?  Where  is   their  next  target?”</p>
<p>“Where  is  the  closest  resource  point  to  Dragon  Roar  Volcano?”</p>
<p>“It  is  clear  water  grassland.”</p>
<p>Clear  water  grassland  was  a  rarely  seen  grassland  in  Western  Desert.  There   was  plenty  of  water  and  lush  grasses  here,  and  it  produced  water  path  and   wood  path  cultivation  resources.</p>
<p>But  just  as  the  anti-Fang  alliance  was  discussing,  they  received  the  news  of   Fang  clan  capturing  clear  water  grassland.</p>
<p>The  anti-Fang  alliance  was  in  an  uproar.</p>
<p>Fang  clan’s  action  this  time  shows  extremely  sharp  offensive  ability  that   was  several  times  more  powerful  than  before.</p>
<p>“Skeleton  Mountain,  Dragon  Roar  Volcano,  clear  water  grassland…  please   take  a  look,  Fang  clan’s  path  is  already  marked,  their  next  target  is  probably   Dong  clan’s  ascending  heavenly  pit!”</p>
<p>“Then  what  are  we  still  waiting  for?!”</p>
<p>“Let’s  go  reinforce  them  immediately.  Dong  clan  sent  a  message,  ascending   heavenly  pit  is  in  Dong  clan  blessed  land  so  it  is  not  heavily  guarded.”</p>
<p>“More  importantly,  Dong  clan  has  not  sent  any  Gu  Immortal  to  guard   ascending  heavenly  pit!”</p>
<p>Gu  Immortals  were  much  fewer  than  resource  points.  In  general,  Gu   Immortals  were  stationed  in  peripheral  resource  points.  And  resource  points   in  blessed  land  would  have  fewer  manpower.</p>
<p>The  anti-Fang  alliance  rushed  to  ascending  heavenly  pit  without  stopping.   But  when  they  arrived,  the  immortal  formation  was  already  broken,  there   was  noise  coming  from  the  depths  of  ascending  heavenly  pit  as  if  Fang  clan   immortals  were  still  plundering  resources.</p>
<p>“We  finally  caught  them!”</p>
<p>“Kill  them!”</p>
<p>“We  must  eradicate  Fang  clan,  otherwise  our  Western  Desert  will  have  no   peace.”</p>
<p>The  anti-Fang  alliance  attacked  with  a  bellyful  of  anger.</p>
<p>But  not  long  later,  an  immortal  formation  rose  from  the  heavenly  pit,  and   trapped  all  of  the  anti-Fang  alliance  members.</p>
<p>“We  were  tricked!”</p>
<p>“Such  a  powerful  immortal  formation,  I  can’t  even  connect  to  treasure   yellow  heaven  or  send  a  message.”</p>
<p>“This  immortal  formation  prioritizes  in  trapping  and  doesn’t  have  much   offensive  power.  Crap!  Fang  clan  intentionally  arranged  this,  they  don’t   want  to  fight  us,  they  are  only  trying  to  plunder  resource  points.”</p>
<p>“Sigh,  what  should  we  do?  I  wonder  which  resource  point  of  Dong  clan’s   will  be  attacked  next.”</p>
<p>Anti-Fang  alliance  members  were  trapped  by  the  formation  and  lost  their   means  to  communicate.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  an  emergency  news  reached  Lin  clan  headquarters:  Fang   clan’s  main  force  suddenly  appeared  in  evil  spirit  desert  and  were  attacking   giant  spirit  oasis.</p>
<p>Giant  spirit  oasis  was  Lin  clan’s  super  resource  point,  it  was  heavily   protected  and  could  not  be  lost.</p>
<p>Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder  was  still  in  closed  cultivation,  the  second   elder  thought  for  a  while  before  deciding  to  make  a  move  personally.  He   controlled  the  two  Immortal  Gu  Houses  of  Lin  clan  and  mobilized  as  much   Gu  Immortals  as  he  could  towards  giant  spirit  oasis.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  he  also  asked  for  reinforcements  from  the  anti-Fang   alliance.</p>
<p>Lin  clan’s  second  supreme  elder  mobilized  their  full  strength,  this  was   because  he  had  no  choice.</p>
<p>Since  Fang  clan  lost  their  territories,  they  could  easily  mobilize  all  their   members.  It  was  extremely  difficult  for  other  super  forces  to  resist  them.</p>
<p>Lin  clan’s  second  supreme  elder  had  to  mobilize  enough  troops  to  match   Fang  clan’s  crazed  attacks.  If  the  mobilized  troops  were  too  few,  they  would   just  be  asking  for  defeat  against  Fang  clan.</p>
<p>But  with  this,  Lin  clan  headquarters  naturally  became  empty.</p>
<p>Bam.</p>
<p>Several  figures  suddenly  landed  and  roughly  killed  their  way  into  Lin  clan’s   headquarters.</p>
<p>They  were  Prince  Feng  Xian,  Red  Heart  Traveler,  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy,  as   well  as  Wan  Zi  Hong  and  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  who  just  arrived  from  ascending   heavenly  pit.</p>
<p>Five  rank  eight  experts  attacked  Lin  clan  headquarters.</p>
<p>“Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder,  we  came  for  you.”  Red  Heart  Traveler  said   loudly.</p>
<p>“If  you  don’t  resist,  you  will  be  able  to  live.”  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  added.</p>
<p>Inside  a  secret  room,  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder  slowly  opened  his  eyes   and  sighed:  ”What  has  my  Lin  clan  done  to  provoke  such  a  grand  action   from  Heavenly  Court?  Heavenly  Court  is  the  leader  of  the  righteous  path,   why  are  you  sneakily  attacking  a  righteous  path  super  force?  My  Lin  clan   has  never  colluded  with  the  demonic  path.”</p>
<p>Wan  Zi  Hong  sneered:  ”Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder,  stop  pretending.  You   act  differently  from  what  you  say,  you  secretly  protected  Fang  clan  while   colluding  with  Fang  Yuan.  Otherwise,  how  can  Fang  clan  be  still  at  large?”</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin  nodded:  ”I  have  already  gathered  sufficient  evidence.”</p>
<p>Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder  was  silent  for  a  bit  before  laughing:   ”Heavenly  Court?  Haha,  you  are  truly  Heavenly  Court.”</p>
