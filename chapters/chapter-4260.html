        <p>: Wan Gu Chou</p>
<p>Rank nine existences, be they Gu Immortals or Immortal Gu, suffered from the envy of the heavens, they could not live forever.</p>
<p>So, in all of humanity’s history, there were only eleven venerables, and they all were restricted by their lifespan.</p>
<p>There were also very few rank nine Immortal Gu that existed in the world.</p>
<p>Giant Sun Immortal Venerable finally took a glance at his luck.</p>
<p>He could not help but frown.</p>
<p>The situation was not good.</p>
<p>It was worse than before.</p>
<p>But from the information he had, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable still could not estimate where this bad luck came from.</p>
<p>Naturally, he was most suspicious of Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>“What is that old woman, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, playing at?”</p>
<p>Giant Sun Immortal Venerable was not anxious.</p>
<p>He had methods to change his luck.</p>
<p>But there was still that flaw.</p>
<p>He was lacking in immortal essence and they needed to be used to refine dao marks. He did not have a rank nine luck path Immortal Gu, using rank</p>
<p>eight luck path Immortal Gu to change his rank nine luck was very difficult and would expend a lot more immortal essence.</p>
<p>Giant Sun Immortal Venerable soon stopped activating his investigative method.</p>
<p>The longer the contest of three venerables prolonged, the bigger the importance of information. But Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s inspection duration kept on decreasing.</p>
<p>He needed to consider his immortal essence expenditure, and try to save as much immortal essence as possible.</p>
<p>Giant Sun Immortal Venerable fell into deep thought: “What is the source of my bad luck?”</p>
<p>“Heavenly Court is the biggest suspect, but I cannot relax my guard against Fang Yuan too! He has the sovereign immortal body and can cultivate all paths, his potential is absolutely terrifying. Besides this, he has another advantage. That is refinement path!”</p>
<p>“Refinement path might not be proficient in fighting, but its development potential far surpasses luck path and blood path. Thus, refinement path has far more potential rank nine Gu than luck path, blood path, as well as wisdom path and star path.”</p>
<p>Each path had strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Giant Sun Immortal Venerable kept luck path a secret and did not spread it, so its development was limited. Other Gu Immortals would find it difficult to defend against Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s luck path methods, but there were few luck path Immortal Gu that could reach rank nine.</p>
<p>On the contrary, refinement path was probably the most widely developed path. Simply because refining Gu was an inevitable part of Gu cultivation.</p>
<p>Even Gu cultivators who cultivated other paths would have refined Gu to some extent.</p>
<p>Thus, as refinement path grew, more refinement path Gu cultivators emerged which meant more refinement path dao marks. Refinement path resources were unceasing, and there were all kinds of refinement path Immortal Gu. Moreover, refinement path Immortal Gu that could advance to rank nine became even more numerous.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, Fang Yuan is lacking immortal essence currently, he is still far from refining a rank nine refinement path Immortal Gu.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, my bad luck is not because of Fang Yuan or Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, but the other venerables. If other venerables revived, who would be the most problematic for me?”</p>
<p>Fang Yuan had Cooking Luck Pot as well as obscured heavenly secret, although Giant Sun Immortal Venerable had the ability to inspect him, he did not get proper results.</p>
<p>“If I gain a breakthrough in the blood path Immortal Gu transaction, this luck should improve.”</p>
<p>Fang Yuan was not the only one who obstructed Giant Sun Immortal Venerable in terms of blood path Immortal Gu, Heavenly Court had already been doing so since Blood Sea Ancestor’s time.</p>
<p>Demon Judgment Board’s core Immortal Gu Blood Relation, and Red Heart Traveler’s heart blood Immortal Gu were things that Giant Sun Immortal Venerable thirsted for.</p>
<p>Currently, Heavenly Lord Bai Zu was still in a long negotiation with Fang Yuan.</p>
<p>Longevity Heaven was secretly negotiating with Heavenly Court as well for blood path Immortal Gu, but the progress was almost zero.</p>
<p>Back in Western Desert.</p>
<p>Fang Gong got close to Xiao Ye Hu and punched.</p>
<p>Under his fear, Xiao Ye Hu moved Immortal Gu House Chamber Pot in front to block.</p>
<p>A loud explosion rang as Chamber Pot was destroyed.</p>
<p>The punch continued forward and struck Xiao Ye Hu’s chest.</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu flew away like a meteor. His chest had sunk in, large amounts of blood mixed with internal organs gushed out of his mouth, leaving a trail of blood.</p>
<p>One punch destroyed Chamber Pot and caused Xiao Ye Hu to be on the verge of death.</p>
<p>“Let’s retreat!”</p>
<p>“We can’t fight anymore.”</p>
<p>The anti-Fang alliance army was shaking with fear, their fighting spirit was almost depleted.</p>
<p>Fang Gong’s strength far surpassed their expectations, he was actually not restricted by Chamber Pot.</p>
<p>This first supreme elder of Fang clan was truly the nemesis of Immortal Gu Houses. Ever since Fang clan attacked Wan clan’s tall pine oasis until now, he had already destroyed Winding Light Platform, Red River Wheel, and Xiao clan’s Chamber Pot.</p>
<p>These three Immortal Gu Houses were all at rank seven, they could match rank eight battle strength!</p>
<p>“There is one more left!” Fang Gong turned around slightly, ignoring the rank seven Gu Immortals as he glared at Myriad Age Building.</p>
<p>Only Myriad Age Building was left among the anti-Fang alliance army’s Immortal Gu Houses.</p>
<p>Myriad Age Building was a rank seven Immortal Gu House, it could match rank eight. It was the final pillar of the anti-Fang alliance army, once it fell, Fang clan would obtain complete victory.</p>
<p>This was the most crucial point.</p>
<p>The remaining Gu Immortals might be rank seven elites with their own specialties, but without Myriad Age Building to stabilize their position, these people would be like a disorderly mob.</p>
<p>“Fang clan has six Immortal Gu Houses, and they are all at rank seven. Our side only has Myriad Age Building left.”</p>
<p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p>
<p>“Heavenly Court is still not making a move? Sigh, they are really incompetent. Look at how much Heaven Refining Demon Venerable supported Fang clan, a total of three Immortal Gu Houses! What did Heavenly Court provide?”</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang displayed a wisdom path Gu Immortal’s strategic ability. At this delicate juncture, he ordered Fang clan to stop chasing those rank seven Gu Immortals, instead controlling Immortal Gu Houses to surround Myriad Age Building.</p>
<p>Seeing that Fang clan did not give chase, besides the Wan clan Gu Immortals, everyone else in the alliance retreated madly.</p>
<p>Wan Xiao’s and Wan Hao Guang’s expressions were ashen as they retreated into Myriad Age Building.</p>
<p>Fang clan’s six Immortal Gu Houses encircled Myriad Age Building, Fang clan’s expression was leisurely as he flew towards Myriad Age Building.</p>
<p>“Surrender, Wan clan. I guarantee in the name of Fang clan that as long as you surrender and cede a portion of your territories, my Fang clan will not ask for your Immortal Gu, nor kill any of you.” Fang Gong said.</p>
<p>Their conditions were actually so lax.</p>
<p>“We won!!” Fang Leng and Fang Yun were already starting to cheer in joy.</p>
<p>The Fang clan immortals did not object to Fang Gong’s surrender terms.</p>
<p>Fang clan had already discussed this, if this kind of situation happened, they would persuade Wan clan to surrender.</p>
<p>If Wan clan surrendered, it would be extremely beneficial to Fang clan.</p>
<p>Once Wan clan admitted their defeat, Fang clan could righteously occupy a portion of Wan clan’s territories.</p>
<p>Wan clan would no longer have a righteous cause to rally the other super forces to organize another anti-Fang alliance.</p>
<p>Naturally, Wan clan’s headquarters and some important resource points would be given back to Wan clan.</p>
<p>But for Fang clan, the overall gains were absolutely much larger than losses.</p>
<p>“Lord Lu Wei Yin, looks like Fang clan has won.”</p>
<p>“Naturally. Just look at who is supporting them!”</p>
<p>Two rockman Gu Immortals were standing beside Lu Wei Yin, showing a prideful smile at this sight.</p>
<p>But Lu Wei Yin was frowning as he sensed something amiss.</p>
<p>“These two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals still have such relaxed expressions, looks like things are not so simple!”</p>
<p>Heavenly Court’s Zhou Xiong Xin and Wan Zi Hong had indifferent expressions with anticipating gazes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a woman’s voice rang out from Myriad Age Building: “Fang clan’s descendants are really amazing, your strategy is also comprehensive, but is my Wan clan so easily bullied?”</p>
<p>Fang clan’s immortals were bewildered.</p>
<p>At this crucial moment, this strange female voice actually spoke as Wan clan’s representative, who was she?</p>
<p>Did Heavenly Court interfere?</p>
<p>But Fang clan knew the information about Wan Zi Hong, and this was not her voice.</p>
<p>“Fairy, may I ask for your name? This is a fight between Fang clan and Wan clan.” Fang Gong frowned, asking inquisitively.</p>
<p>“Hahaha!” The mysteriously female immortal laughed loudly. Her voice was hoarse and unpleasant, but it was filled with complete confidence.</p>
<p>Following the laughter, a vast rank eight aura spread out.</p>
<p>“As wind, dust, and flowers scatter,</p>
<p>People and eras change beyond recognition.</p>
<p>As the frigid bells of time shatter,</p>
<p>None can dispel the sorrow of myriad ages!”</p>
<p>As the recital ended, heaven and earth turned dark.</p>
<p>Cold mournful wind and bleak clouds filled the sky.</p>
<p>Inside several li of radius, all living beings, including Gu Immortals of both sides, felt an intense sorrow attacking their minds.</p>
<p>Sorrow, sorrow, and more sorrow!</p>
<p>Dejection, disappointment, depression, worry… all kinds of negative emotions made the people shed tears, their hearts felt stifled and suffocated.</p>
<p>Fang clan’s six Immortal Gu Houses surrounding Myriad Age Building became unsteady as they started shaking, almost falling down.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang, who was inside Thought Expelling Pavilion, was half- kneeling. His expression was distorted as he resisted Wan clan’s terrifying killer move with all his strength, blood seeping out of his mouth and nose!</p>
<p>Fang Gong barely managed to resist, retreating in panic as he exclaimed: “You are Wan Gu Chou[1]?!”</p>
<p>In just a short few moments, more wrinkles appeared on his face, he was growing old rapidly as close to one hundred years were extracted from his lifespan!</p>
<p>“Retreat….” Fang Di Chang said with much difficulty.</p>
<p>Fang clan’s six Immortal Gu Houses retreated in panic.</p>
<p>The alliance immortals who had already retreated to the edge of the battlefield were dumbfounded at this sight.</p>
<p>“Wan Gu Chou?! Isn’t that female immortal the strongest peak rank eight in Wan clan’s history?”</p>
<p>“When she was alive, Wan clan almost dominated the whole of Western Desert!”</p>
<p>“She lived for ten thousand years, Myriad Age Building was created by her.”</p>
<p>“She is actually alive?!”</p>
<p>“Right, this is very likely to be Heavenly Court’s move.”</p>
<p>“It must be her! Her move, everlasting sorrow, is famous throughout history, only she who cultivates both time path and wisdom path can use it. And she is the only one who can amplify this move to such a terrifying degree through Myriad Age Building!”</p>
<p>“This move already possesses the air of pseudo venerable level!!”</p>
<p>The immortals were shaken.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou stopped the killer move as she said to the alliance Gu Immortals: “Are you still not making a move?”</p>
<p>The immortals understood at once, they charged over with battle cries.</p>
<p>Fang clan was struck by the killer move everlasting sorrow, the sorrowful and depressive feelings were hard to get rid of, they could not even use twenty percent of their battle strength and had to retreat in defeat.</p>
<p>Under Myriad Age Building’s lead, the alliance army gave chase.</p>
<p>The immortals first destroyed Smoke Wave Building, then destroyed Thought Expelling Pavilion.</p>
<p>To save Fang Di Chang who was in Thought Expelling Pavilion, Fang Gong and the other immortals were forced to make a move.</p>
<p>After a deadly battle, Fang Di Chang was rescued, but Fang clan paid a disastrous price for this.</p>
<p>Their most exceptional Immortal Gu House, Fallen Flower Hall, was destroyed, Fang Dong Xi and Fang An Lei, these two elite rank sevens, died in the battle.</p>
<p>Finally, Fang clan brought the remaining three damaged Immortal Gu Houses and left the battlefield.</p>
