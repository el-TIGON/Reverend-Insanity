    <h1>Chapter  2296</h1>
    <p>:  Fei  Wu  Revives</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  a  strange  expression.</p>
<p>Just  earlier,  a  transaction  between  him  and  Heaven  Refining  Demon   Venerable  was  held.</p>
<p>Both  sides  obtained  what  they  wanted.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan  has  needs  for  childbirth,  what  is  he  planning?”</p>
<p>This  transaction  made  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  quite  suspicious.</p>
<p>But  he  knew  that  because  of  dao  marks,  Gu  Immortal  found  it  hard  to  give   birth.  And  in  terms  of  having  children,  among  the  venerables,  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  was  the  most  experienced.</p>
<p>Among  the  venerables,  which  other  person  had  more  children  than  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable?</p>
<p>Back  then,  to  raise  more  children,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  searched   the  world  for  countless  beauties,  creating  his  five  harem  palaces!</p>
<p>“If  Fang  Yuan  did  not  suddenly  have  this  need,  we  would  not  have  done  this   transaction.  Sigh…  to  think  that  I  would  benefit  now  because  of  you,  Zhu</p>
<p>Zhu.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  muttered  a  name  as  the  memories  of  a  scene   emerged  in  the  depths  of  his  heart.</p>
<p>Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>In  a  temporary  tribe,  tents  were  set  up.</p>
<p>The  flap  of  an  old  and  tattered  tent  was  pulled  side  as  middle-aged  Giant   Sun  barged  in,  shouting:  ”Zhu  Zhu,  what  Gu  did  you  secretly  use  on  me   again?”</p>
<p>Middle-aged  Giant  Sun  had  a  bare  chest  that  exposed  his  manly  stature,  but   there  was  a  pig  head  resting  on  his  shoulders.</p>
<p>Zhu  Zhu  saw  him  and  laughed:  ”It  worked!”</p>
<p>Middle-aged  Giant  Sun  was  furious:  ”Zhu  Zhu,  I  was  discussing  matters   with  the  tribe  elders  earlier  when  this  happened.  You  will  turn  me  into  the   laughing  stock  of  the  tribe.”</p>
<p>Zhu  Zhu  sighed:  ”Husband,  I  apologize.  But  I  just  want  a  child.”</p>
<p>Middle-aged  Giant  Sun  was  stunned  before  becoming  dejected,  his  anger   faded  away:  ”It’s  my  fault  for  being  useless.”</p>
<p>“No,  it  is  my  issue.  Technically,  I  have  half  a  Gu  Immortal’s  body.  It  is  my   fault!”  Zhu  Zhu  stood  before  Giant  Sun  as  she  held  his  pig  head,  saying   with  love  and  affection:  ”This  time,  I  used  transformation  path  Gu.”</p>
<p>“Do  you  know?  This  is  called  sowing  pig.  It  is  an  amazing  wild  beast  that   has  gone  extinct.  The  male  pig  would  eat  in  autumn  and  get  fat  to  spit  out  a   type  of  crystal  flower.  When  spring  arrives,  the  crystal  flower  will  bloom   and  the  female  pig  will  eat  it  to  nurture  new  life  in  its  body.”</p>
<p>Middle-aged  Giant  Sun’s  eyes  shone:  ”It  is  so  effective?”</p>
<p>Zhu  Zhu  smiled  and  pulled  his  hand,  dragging  him  into  bed:  ”Let’s  go.”</p>
<p>Middle-aged  Giant  Sun  laughed  loudly  as  he  pounced  at  Zhu  Zhu.</p>
<p>At  the  top  of  their  tent,  there  was  a  flag.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  the  flag  started  waving  around  intensely  like  the  wind  was   blowing.</p>
<p>But  after  just  a  few  breaths  of  time,  the  flag  went  motionless.</p>
<p>Within  the  tent,  Giant  Sun  spoke  in  a  guilty  tone:  ”Sorry,  Zhu  Zhu,  I  can’t   continue  anymore.”</p>
<p>Zhu  Zhu  smiled:  ”Don’t  worry,  I  have  my  methods.”</p>
<p>Next,  Giant  Sun  let  out  a  soft  growl  as  the  tent  started  to  shake  again  like  a   hurricane  was  blowing.</p>
<p>This  time,  he  lasted  for  over  ten  breaths  of  time.</p>
<p>The  commotion  in  the  tent  stopped  again.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  sighed:  ”Sorry,  I  can’t  continue  anymore.”</p>
<p>Zhu  Zhu  smiled  and  said:  ”Don’t  worry,  watch  this.”</p>
<p>For  the  third  time,  the  tent  shook  intensely  like  there  was  a  storm.</p>
<p>But  this  storm  only  lasted  for  around  twenty  breaths  of  time  before   stopping.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  breathed  roughly  as  he  said:  ”Sorry,  I  really  can’t  continue   anymore.”</p>
<p>Zhu  Zhu  was  still  smiling:  ”Don’t  worry,  I  still  have  some  methods  left.”</p>
<p>“Wait,  wait.”  Giant  Sun  said  weakly:  ”I  am  amazed  that  you  have  so  many   methods,  but  let  me  rest,  let  me  rest…”</p>
<p>Zhu  Zhu  replied  humbly:  ”Although  I  have  many  methods,  the  results  are   not  good.  Sigh…  the  most  useful  method  can  only  come  from  Ren  Zu,  all   of  the  humans  of  the  five  regions  and  two  heavens  are  descendants  of  Ren   Zu!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  immediately  patted  his  chest  and  assured:  ”Don’t  worry,  one  day,   I  will  comprehend  Ren  Zu’s  method  and  we  will  have  countless   descendants!”</p>
<p>His  recollection  ended  here.</p>
<p>A  deep  feeling  of  disappointment  lingered  in  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable’s  heart.</p>
<p>In  his  previous  life,  he  had  already  grasped  such  a  method,  otherwise,  how   could  he  have  so  many  descendants?</p>
<p>It  was  just  that  he  could  not  use  this  method  with  Zhu  Zhu  anymore.</p>
<p>He  could  never  see  her  again.</p>
<p>His  children  were  also  not  of  her  bloodline.</p>
<p>After  collecting  his  thoughts,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  expression   turned  calm  and  cool  again.</p>
<p>He  inspected  the  gains  from  this  transaction,  he  had  obtained  a  lot  of  blood   path  research  results  from  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Although  he  had  been  been  secretly  making  deductions  on  blood  path,  Fang   Yuan’s  research  results  still  saved  him  a  lot  of  time  and  energy.</p>
<p>Other  than  that,  there  were  five  blood  path  Immortal  Gu!</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  refined  them  into  his  own  and  tossed  them   into  Blood  Sea.</p>
<p>“Blood  Sea…”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  gaze  pierced  through  the   ground  of  Longevity  Heaven,  gazing  into  Blood  Sea.</p>
<p>Even  if  rank  nine  light  Gu  was  repaired,  it  was  not  suitable  for  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>However,  although  he  had  no  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  could  use  Blood  Sea  as  a  replacement  temporarily.</p>
<p>There  were  four  different  levels  when  it  came  to  dao  mark  density:  dao   marks  that  were  scattered  all  over  the  world,  resource  points  that  were   created  when  dao  marks  were  arranged  in  a  certain  manner,  the  apex  of   resource  points—secluded  domains  of  heaven  and  earth,  as  well  as  the   essence  of  heaven  and  earth—Gu.</p>
<p>A  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth  was  considered  half  a  rank  nine   Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>When  Gu  Immortals  use  immortal  materials  to  form  killer  moves  or   immortal  formations,  the  materials  were  consumable  and  could  not  have  a   stable  form,  thus,  the  dao  marks  were  lost  after  usage.</p>
<p>But  a  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth  could  be  used  as  a  long  term   stable  core  to  form  killer  moves.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  reverse  flow  protection  seal  and  Dang  Hun  Luo  Po  Seal  were   such  examples.</p>
<p>“Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  has  Mental  Domain,  while  Fang   Yuan  may  have  Refinement  Sea,  this  Blood  Sea  is  the  foundation  that  I   need  to  resist  them!”</p>
<p>Back  then,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  worked  with  Long  Hair   Ancestor  to  refine  Gu,  he  knew  about  this  grand  plan  of  Long  Hair   Ancestor’s.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  felt  that  for  this  period  of  time,  refining   natural  dao  marks  of  heaven  and  earth  was  the  most  important  thing.  Trying</p>
<p>to  get  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  that  was  suitable  for  himself  was  not   realistic.  In  this  case,  a  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth  was  the  best   substitute.</p>
<p>“Among  the  venerables,  the  one  who  has  the  highest  hope  of  getting  a  rank   nine  Immortal  Gu  is  Fang  Yuan.  In  terms  of  potential,  he  is  also  the   highest.”</p>
<p>“Thankfully,  he  has  insufficient  immortal  essence  and  is  unable  to  refine   rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.”</p>
<p>“Once  he  starts  refining  Gu,  he  will  expose  his  greatest  weakness.  At  that   time,  I  will  work  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  stop  him!”</p>
<p>“If  Fang  Yuan  is  able  to  refine  any  refinement  path  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,   then  he  will  have  an  easier  time  refining  other  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  in  the   future.  This  will  snowball  into  an  unstoppable  advantage  at  an  increasing   speed.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  reminded  himself  of  the  fact.</p>
<p>Blood  Sea  surged  with  huge  waves  that  ebbed  and  flowed,  it  was  gradually   expanding  in  size.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  nodded  to  himself:  ”With  five  more  blood   path  Immortal  Gu,  the  rate  at  which  Blood  Sea  is  forming  is  increasing.  In   half  a  year,  it  will  be  completed!”</p>
<p>Blood  Sea  was  currently  incomplete.</p>
<p>Although  a  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth  could  be  used  as  the  core   of  a  killer  move,  it  was  quite  a  wasteful  thing  to  do  as  the  secluded  domain   itself  would  be  expended  to  a  huge  extent.</p>
<p>For  example,  Fang  Yuan’s  previously  incomplete  Refinement  Sea  and   Human  Sea  (although  Human  Sea  was  complete,  only  the  whole  Human   Mountain  and  Sea  was  considered  a  secluded  domain).</p>
<p>“Oh?”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  expression  changed,  an  intense  luck   path  intuition  emerged  in  his  heart.</p>
<p>The  last  time  he  had  such  a  feeling,  he  revived  Light  Emperor.</p>
<p>The  revival  of  Light  Emperor  caused  him  to  gain  rank  nine  light  Gu.</p>
<p>Now?</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  feeling  expectant.</p>
<p>Although  reviving  another  person  now  would  expend  the  incomplete  Blood   Sea,  he  did  not  hesitate  as  he  used  the  immortal  killer  move  once  again  —   Destined  Birth  Through  Luck.</p>
<p>Swish  swish  swish!</p>
<p>Blood  Sea  surged  and  created  a  huge  wave  that  was  tens  of  feet  tall.</p>
<p>Blood  Sea  was  rapidly  expended  as  a  huge  whirlpool  was  formed  again.</p>
<p>After  the  flickering  of  shadow  and  light,  a  rank  seven  Gu  Immortal  emerged   from  within.</p>
<p>“Who  is  this?”  Yao  Huang  did  not  recognize  the  person.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  expectations  rose  again.  The  reason  was   that  this  Gu  Immortal’s  revival  expended  even  more  immortal  essence  and   portion  of  the  Blood  Sea  than  Light  Emperor.</p>
<p>But  he  was  just  a  rank  seven  water  path  Gu  Immortal.</p>
<p>“Oh,  are  you  Fei  Wu?”  Yao  Huang  stared  for  some  time  before  shouting  out   loud.</p>
<p>“Fei  tribe’s  final  first  supreme  elder  —  Fei  Wu[1.  Same  pronunciation  as   trash/worthless.]?”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  frowned.</p>
<p>He  remembered  now.</p>
<p>Fei  tribe  was  once  a  super  force  in  Northern  Plains,  it  had  genuine  Huang   Jin  bloodline.</p>
<p>Fei  tribe’s  first  generation  ancestor  was  not  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s   son  but  someone  who  was  many  generations  below.  But  Fei  tribe  was  still   very  famous  in  history.</p>
<p>Or  rather,  infamous.</p>
<p>Fei  tribe  was  a  Huang  Jin  super  tribe  that  ruined  itself.</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  was  their  final  first  supreme  elder,  he  was  undeniably  responsible   for  their  destruction.</p>
<p>Many  people  felt  that  he  was  incapable  and  too  greedy,  he  let  down  the   entire  Fei  tribe  and  caused  their  destruction.</p>
<p>When  he  was  the  first  supreme  elder,  he  expended  Fei  tribe’s  vast  amount   of  resources  and  almost  caused  them  to  go  broke.  As  a  result,  the  other  Fei   tribe  Gu  Immortals  lacked  cultivation  resources  and  grew  slowly,  this   resulted  in  their  internal  conflict.</p>
<p>The  external  world  also  gave  Fei  tribe  a  lot  of  pressure.</p>
<p>But  Fei  Wu  did  not  handle  this  well,  he  had  always  shown  a  weak  attitude   to  the  outside  world.</p>
<p>In  order  to  satisfy  his  own  needs,  Fei  Wu  even  gave  up  many  resource   points  that  Fei  tribe  owned.  The  result  was  that  his  battle  did  not  seem  to   rise.</p>
<p>Fei  Wu’s  performance  disappointed  everyone,  in  the  end,  he  even  led  Fei   tribe  to  excavate  and  develop  in  one  of  Northern  Plains’  ten  great  fierce   areas.  In  the  end,  he  triggered  a  terrifying  beast  tide  and  caused  Fei  tribe’s   territory  to  be  engulfed,  even  their  headquarters  was  taken  down.  Most  of   their  Gu  Immortals  died  in  the  beast  tide,  while  the  remaining  ones  were   quickly  annexed  and  taken  in  by  the  other  Huang  Jin  tribes.</p>
<p>After  the  beast  tide  was  over,  Fei  tribe  was  wiped  out  while  Fei  Wu  died   pitifully  inside  the  fierce  area.  Their  remaining  territory  was  also  taken  by   the  various  tribes.</p>
<p>Fei  tribe  became  a  laughingstock  and  the  prime  negative  example  for   people  to  learn  from.</p>
<p>“How  can  such  a  useless  person  who  harmed  his  entire  tribe  appear  now?”   Yao  Huang  felt  confused  and  suspicious.</p>
<p>After  realizing  his  revival,  Fei  Wu  reacted  and  paid  his  respects  to  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable:  ”Unfilial  descendant,  Fei  Wu,  greets  Lord   Ancestor!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  already  used  his  luck  inspection  method   to  observe  Fei  Wu’s  foundation.</p>
<p>He  was  shocked  to  find  out  that  Fei  Wu’s  luck  was  actually  quite  sizable,   far  surpassing  most  rank  sevens  while  being  lower  than  an  average  rank   eight.  More  importantly,  Fei  Wu’s  luck  had  a  close  connection  to  a  certain   existence  far  away,  this  existence’s  luck  had  an  influence  on  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  himself.</p>
<p>But  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  a  rank  nine  venerable,  to  think  that   there  was  actually  an  entity  whose  luck  could  affect  him  so  intensely.</p>
<p>Soon,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  voice  penetrated  the  ground  and   reached  Blood  Sea:  ”The  truth  is  often  buried  deep  in  history.  Fei  Wu,  my   descendant,  tell  me  the  truth.”</p>
