        <p>:  Floating  Refinement  Hive</p>
<p>Inside  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>“So,  can  you  tell  me  anything  about  my  father?”  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang   looked  at  the  hairy  man  Gu  Immortal  in  front  of  him.</p>
<p>Beside  him,  there  was  a  female  immortal.</p>
<p>The  hairy  man  Gu  Immortal  Twelfth  Hair  took  a  look  at  the  female   immortal  before  casting  his  gaze  at  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang.</p>
<p>This  female  immortal  was  mermaid  Lian  Ke  Xin.</p>
<p>It  turned  out  that  after  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  passed  the  tribulation  to  become   a  Gu  Immortal  and  returned  to  the  hairy  man  continent,  he  saw  his  mother —Steel  Thread  City  Lord—who  was  in  an  unconscious  state.</p>
<p>Lian  Ke  Xin  had  been  helping  him  with  his  tribulation,  she  explained  the   truth  of  this  world  to  him,  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  realized  that  to  save  his   mother,  he  needed  to  make  sufficient  contributions  to  the  Great  Love   Immortal  Venerable  of  this  world.  In  that  case,  he  could  use  contribution   points  that  he  earned  to  issue  a  mission  for  those  healing  Gu  Immortals  to   heal  his  mother.</p>
<p>Moreover,  Lian  Ke  Xin  told  Fang  Xiang  that  this  hairy  man  continent  was   governed  by  a  hairy  man  Gu  Immortal,  if  he  wanted  to  find  his  father,  he   could  go  and  ask  him.</p>
<p>Under  Lian  Ke  Xin’s  lead,  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  met  Twelfth  Hair  for  the   first  time,  he  asked  about  the  information  regarding  his  father.</p>
<p>Twelfth  Hair  nodded:  ”I  do  know  something…  about  your  father.  But  that  is   from  long  ago,  if  you  want  to  know,  help  me  with  something.”</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  was  a  little  hesitant,  he  did  not  agree  immediately.</p>
<p>Lian  Ke  Xin  saw  this  and  immediately  said:  ”Friend  Twelfth  Hair,  Fang   Xiang  has  just  become  an  immortal,  if  you  want  to  request  a  difficult  task,   we  will  have  to  decline.”</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  casted  a  grateful  gaze  at  Lian  Ke  Xin.</p>
<p>Twelfth  Hair  laughed  loudly:  ”Friend  Fang  Xiang  has  half  of  our  hairy  man   bloodline,  why  will  I  bully  him?  Don’t  worry,  this  matter  involves  the   arrangement  of  Floating  Refinement  Hive.”</p>
<p>“Oh?  You  have  already  refined  this  hive?”  Lian  Ke  Xin  was  really   surprised.</p>
<p>Twelfth  Hair  answered:  ”With  the  method  that  our  master  created   personally,  we  hairy  man  Gu  Immortals  only  had  to  follow  the  instructions   to  achieve  success.”</p>
<p>Next,  Twelfth  Hair  looked  at  Fang  Xiang:  ”Floating  Refinement  Hive  has   already  been  created,  you  only  need  to  place  it  inside  Refinement  Sea.  This   is  much  easier  than  creating  it,  if  you  can  complete  the  mission,  I  will  tell   you  things  about  your  father.”</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  could  not  decide,  he  looked  towards  Lian  Ke  Xin   subconsciously.</p>
<p>Lian  Ke  Xin  smiled  at  him  and  nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright,  I’ll  do  it.”  Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  immediately  decided.</p>
<p>Thus,  Twelfth  Hair  transferred  the  Floating  Refinement  Hive  into  Gu  Yue   Fang  Xiang’s  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Xiang  saw  the  Floating  Refinement  Hive  for  the  first  time,   this  structure  was  quite  peculiar,  it  was  large  as  a  mountain  but  had  the   appearance  and  structure  of  a  beehive,  there  were  many  small  spaces  of   various  sizes  inside.</p>
<p>Floating  Refinement  Hive  had  a  narrow  top  and  a  broad  bottom  which  was   the  base  of  the  hive,  it  could  float  on  the  sea  and  resist  huge  waves  with   great  stability.</p>
<p>“This  is  amazing!”  Fang  Xiang  used  investigative  methods  and  observed,   his  eyes  stared  wide  in  amazement.</p>
<p>Twelfth  Hair  laughed  and  said  in  a  proud  tone:  ”This  is  invented  by  our   master,  of  course  it  is  amazing.  Each  Floating  Refinement  Hive  can  be   considered  an  incomplete  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth.  It  contains   countless  refinement  path  dao  marks,  if  one  refined  Gu  inside,  not  only  will   the  success  rate  be  much  higher,  they  can  even  save  on  the  cost  of  Gu   refinement.”</p>
<p>“Floating  Refinement  Hive  can  not  only  accommodate  countless  refinement   path  Gu  Masters,  it  can  also  hold  ten  refinement  path  Gu  Immortals  at  most.   With  refinement  path  Gu  Immortals  stationed  here,  the  hive  can   continuously  produce  Immortal  Gu!  Each  Floating  Refinement  Hive  can  be   seen  as  a  refinement  path  super  resource  point.”</p>
<p>“Alright,  there  is  no  time,  get  going  now.”</p>
<p>Fang  Xiang  nodded  and  immediately  set  off  to  Refinement  Sea  with  Lian   Ke  Xin.</p>
<p>Refinement  Sea  was  at  the  center  of  Mini  Eastern  Sea,  it  was  not  large   compared  to  the  other  sea  areas  but  it  had  extraordinary  value.</p>
<p>“This  is  a  genuine  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth!”  After  hearing   Lian  Ke  Xin’s  explanation,  Fang  Yuan  understood  the  value  of  Refinement   Sea.</p>
<p>“Master  is  really  amazing!  His  methods  are  unfathomable  like  true   immortal  deities,  he  can  even  create  his  own  secluded  domain  of  heaven   and  earth.”  Fang  Xiang  praised  continuously.</p>
<p>The  current  Refinement  Sea  had  already  been  completed  by  Fang  Yuan,  it   was  a  genuine  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth!</p>
<p>Back  then,  Lang  Ya  land  spirit  used  calamities  and  tribulations  to  collect   water  path  dao  marks  and  painstakingly  built  the  incomplete  Refinement   Sea.  After  Fang  Yuan  obtained  it,  his  speed  of  building  it  was  many  times   faster.</p>
<p>Firstly,  Fang  Yuan  was  a  venerable,  he  was  even  stronger  than  Long  Hair   Ancestor,  not  to  mention  Lang  Ya  land  spirit.</p>
<p>Secondly,  Fang  Yuan  was  a  supreme  grandmaster  in  refinement  path.  The   current  supreme  grandmaster  was  far  superior  to  the  supreme  grandmaster   of  the  past.</p>
<p>Thirdly,  Fang  Yuan  had  sovereign  immortal  body  with  non-conflicting  dao   marks,  he  could  use  methods  of  any  path.  He  directly  used  water  path   methods  that  were  far  more  efficient  than  Lang  Ya  land  spirit’s  idea.</p>
<p>Fang  Xiang  soon  found  his  destination,  but  there  was  a  need  to  create  an   immortal  formation  here.  The  content  was  much  more  difficult  that  he   imagined.</p>
<p>That  was  because  there  was  more  than  one  Floating  Refinement  Hive,  in  the   current  Refinement  Sea,  there  were  many  other  hives.</p>
<p>Arranging  the  Floating  Refinement  Hive  was  not  as  simple  as  dumping  it   here.  It  needed  a  stable  location  to  form  a  certain  connection  with  the   surrounding  Floating  Refinement  Hives.</p>
<p>After  the  Floating  Refinement  Hives  reached  a  certain  number,  the   immortal  formation  would  activate  and  cause  all  the  hives  to  float  around   with  the  waves  of  Refinement  Sea.</p>
<p>They  were  like  ink  pens  that  drew  a  painting  on  this  Refinement  Sea  as  the   canvas.  Refinement  Sea  helped  the  Refinement  Hives  to  refine  Gu  while  the   Refinement  Hives  replenished  the  Refinement  Sea  after  it  was  expended   greatly.</p>
<p>This  was  a  grand  system  that  was  established!</p>
<p>Under  Lian  Ke  Xin’s  guidance  and  cooperation,  Fang  Xiang  started   arranging  the  immortal  formation.</p>
<p>Three  days  later,  they  only  completed  ten  percent  of  it.</p>
<p>“This  will  not  do,  it  is  too  slow.”  Lian  Ke  Xin  immediately  decided  as  she   used  some  contribution  points  to  post  a  mission  to  recruit  helpers.</p>
<p>Not  long  after,  a  Gu  Immortal  came.</p>
<p>“I  am  a  newly  advanced  formation  path  Gu  Immortal,  Ni  Lao  Shi.”  This  Ni   clan  Gu  Immortal  was  a  purebred  human,  he  accepted  Lian  Ke  Xin’s   mission.</p>
<p>With  his  help,  there  was  rapid  progress.</p>
<p>Three  days  passed,  the  arrangement  of  Refinement  Hive  was  finally   completed.</p>
<p>Fang  Xiang  and  Ni  Lao  Shi  left  with  lingering  reluctance,  they  became   good  friends  after  three  days.</p>
<p>Fang  Xiang  had  spent  his  entire  life  on  the  hairy  man  continent,  he  rarely   interacted  with  humans.  He  knew  that  his  father  was  a  human,  so  he  bore   curiosity  and  good  feelings  for  them.</p>
<p>Ni  Lao  Shi  was  honest  and  loyal,  it  was  natural  that  they  became  good   friends.</p>
<p>Fang  Xiang’s  perspective  of  the  humans  improved  again.</p>
<p>After  completing  Twelfth  Hair’s  mission,  he  returned  to  the  hairy  man   continent  and  asked  about  his  father.</p>
<p>As  for  Ni  Lao  Shi,  he  took  a  sum  of  contribution  points  from  Lian  Ke  Xin   and  immediately  went  back  to  his  clan.</p>
<p>After  returning  to  Ni  clan’s  territory,  he  was  welcomed  by  the  entire  clan’s   cheers.</p>
<p>Ni  clan  was  originally  situated  in  Southern  Border,  it  was  moved  into  the   sovereign  immortal  aperture  by  Fang  Yuan  to  research  the  human  path  Gu   refinement  method.</p>
<p>Right  now,  Fang  Yuan  became  a  refinement  path  venerable,  Ni  clan  lost  its   value  but  still  remained  in  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  to  develop.</p>
<p>Ni  clan  had  several  Gu  Immortal  seeds,  but  the  least  outstanding  Ni  Lao  Shi   actually  succeeded  in  the  immortal  ascension.</p>
<p>With  a  Gu  Immortal,  Ni  clan  became  a  super  force.</p>
<p>Ni  Lao  Shi  assembled  the  higher-ups  of  Ni  clan  and  expressed  his  thoughts   to  them.</p>
<p>“One  of  master’s  clones  has  some  gains  from  researching  dream  path,  he  is   able  to  create  a  dream  path  formation  to  raise  the  aptitude  of  an  entire  clan.   I  already  have  sufficient  contribution  points,  I’ll  bring  you  to  the  formation   now,  what  do  you  think?”</p>
<p>Seeing  that  Ni  Lao  Shi  had  become  an  immortal  but  did  not  forget  his  roots,   the  higher-ups  were  very  moved  that  he  still  cared  about  their  development,   they  nodded  their  heads  in  agreement.</p>
<p>Ni  Lao  Shi  placed  the  clansmen  into  his  immortal  aperture  as  he  set  off  to   find  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>After  Ni  Lao  Shi  paid  his  respects  and  stated  his  intention,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen   brought  him  to  a  dream  path  formation.</p>
<p>Ni  Lao  Shi  paid  the  necessary  contribution  points  as  Meng  Qiu  Zhen   activated  the  formation.  The  former  opened  his  immortal  aperture  door  and   let  out  his  clansmen  who  walked  into  the  dream  path  formation.</p>
<p>“Will  there  be  any  issues?”  Ni  Lao  Shi  stared  with  a  fixed  gaze  until  the   final  Ni  clansman  walked  into  the  formation.</p>
<p>He  had  an  expression  of  worry  as  he  said  that,  especially  when  his  parents   were  among  them.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  smiled  lightly  as  he  shook  his  head:  ”How  can  that  be?   Don’t  worry.”</p>
<p>Saying  so,  he  activated  the  formation.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  all  the  Ni  clansmen  who  entered  the  formation  fell   onto  the  ground  as  some  started  snoring,  they  had  all  fallen  asleep.</p>
<p>However,  there  was  a  chain  of  explosions  that  soon  followed.</p>
<p>These  Ni  clansmen  had  all  self-detonated  and  died  in  their  dreams.</p>
<p>Their  blood  was  extracted  by  the  formation  and  pumped  into  the  sole   surviving  Ni  clansman.</p>
<p>After  completing  everything,  Human  Sea  who  was  deep  within  the   formation  also  activated.</p>
<p>Thus,  the  self-detonated  Ni  clansmen  were  revived  but  they  remained   asleep.</p>
<p>“How  many  clans  have  already  come  to  this  place?”  Ni  Lao  Shi  asked.</p>
<p>“There  were  four,  you  are  the  fifth  clan.”  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  said:  ”Don’t   worry,  this  formation  is  very  safe.”</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  the  Ni  clansmen  started  the  second  round  of  self- detonation,  but  this  time,  the  final  survivor  was  switched  to  another  person.</p>
<p>Like  this,  they  were  revived  and  slaughtered  continuously  until  all  the  Ni   clan  members’  aptitude  rose.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  stopped  the  formation  and  woke  them  up.</p>
<p>Immediately,  waves  of  astonishment  hit  the  Ni  clansmen  as  they  cheered   and  shouted  with  loud  voices.</p>
<p>“Amazing,  my  aptitude  improved!”</p>
<p>“What  method  is  this?  It  is  so  strong,  so  strong!”</p>
<p>“Ni  Lao  Shi  is  a  really  good  child,  he  did  not  forget  us  even  after  immortal   ascension,  he  repaid  us  fully.”</p>
<p>Ni  Lao  Shi  inspected  everyone,  almost  all  of  them  had  A  grade  aptitude.</p>
<p>“This  is  truly  a  miracle.  I  guess  only  someone  like  master  can  perform  such   legendary  acts.”  Ni  Lao  Shi  was  very  shocked,  his  admiration  towards  Fang   Yuan  grew  deeper.</p>
<p>But  he  did  not  know  the  truth.</p>
<p>Dream  path  formation?  No,  this  was  clearly  a  blood  path  formation!</p>
<p>But  dream  path  was  a  great  cover  that  could  convince  many  Gu  Immortals.   After  all,  they  had  all  fallen  asleep,  it  was  quite  similar  to  dream  path   methods,  so  this  seemed  quite  normal  on  the  surface.</p>
