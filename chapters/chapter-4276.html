        <p>: Awkwardness of the Anti-Fang</p>
<p>Alliance</p>
<p>Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p>
<p>Western Desert, Fang clan's headquarters.</p>
<p>"Open!" Mo Sha Ta shouted.</p>
<p>The killer move was activated, the immortal formation ahead was forced open.</p>
<p>The inside was completely empty.</p>
<p>Not a shred of resources were left, it was completely barren.</p>
<p>"This again!" Many Gu Immortals were angry and frustrated.</p>
<p>"Emptied, they emptied this as wellâ€¦" Some muttered to themselves with expressions of dejectedness.</p>
<p>"Fang clan is so ruthless!" Some Gu Immortals' eyes were spewing fire, they gritted their teeth angrily.</p>
<p>"Just Fang clan alone cannot have such manpower or methods, they must be backed by Heaven Refining Demon Venerable!" Some of the Gu Immortals felt helpless.</p>
<p>This was Fang clan's final resource point.</p>
<p>Like the earlier resource points, nothing was left to the anti-Fang alliance.</p>
<p>The Gu Immortals discussed among themselves, it was a rowdy scene.</p>
<p>This was too different from their expectations!</p>
<p>Fang clan had not only emptied the resource points, they also left the immortal formations behind. These immortal formations were created using natural dao marks and immortal materials.</p>
<p>When the anti-Fang alliance tried to break the immortal formation, they had to spend immortal essence as well.</p>
<p>They wasted a bunch of immortal essence and ended up with no gains.</p>
<p>Looking at these deep pits or desolate land, the anti-Fang alliance's members had grim expressions.</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu did not even have the energy to get angry.</p>
<p>He was feeling regret.</p>
<p>"Had I known this, I would not have interfered in this stupid matter!"</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu's own injuries had not healed yet, and most importantly, his Immortal Gu House Chamber Pot was ruined.</p>
<p>It was not that he had no gains, but the things he got could not make up for his losses.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou looked at this scene and sighed internally, she was also feeling quite helpless.</p>
<p>In her first life, she had not seen any super force with no bottom line like this, it was truly a new experience now.</p>
<p>She led the anti-Fang alliance and attacked, along the route, they did not meet any Fang clan Gu Immortal, even though they broke many immortal formations, there were no resource points inside, many of the immortal formations were even tampered with, if they could not open it properly, it would explode!</p>
<p>This was too devious!</p>
<p>Many Gu Immortals suffered injuries because of this.</p>
<p>Even Fang clan's headquarters had been relocated, it could not be found.</p>
<p>This was a public blessed land, but Fang clan actually had a method to relocate the immortal aperture!</p>
<p>There was a saying on Earth, the monk can run away but the temple cannot, but now, Fang clan directly brought the temple with them.</p>
<p>Even though Wan Gu Chou did not know this saying, her mood was just as horrible.</p>
<p>Even though they defeated Fang clan, Wan Gu Chou was not feeling happy at all, she was instead filled with worries.</p>
<p>Fang clan vanished but they retained most of their battle strength.</p>
<p>Right now, it was Wan clan and the other super forces' turn to feel worried. It was possible that Fang clan would attack one of their resource points one day, and the chance of defending it was low!</p>
<p>Fang clan did not have resource points left, they did not need to have Gu Immortals stationed to guard them. If they attacked all at once, they could turn their passive situation into an active one.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou looked at the Heavenly Court Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>In this situation, Heavenly Court and Wan clan were on the same side, their benefits were tied together.</p>
<p>And in fact, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had issued orders long ago to exterminate the whole of Fang clan.</p>
<p>Thus, after Zhou Xiong Xin sensed Wan Gu Chou's gaze, he said without hesitation: "Fang clan's actions are crippling their foundation, they have completely submitted to Heaven Refining Demon Venerable. This means that Fang clan is the same as Fang Yuan, they are all demons, they are threats to this world!"</p>
<p>"Don't say these things to us, what are we going to do now?" The other Western Desert Gu Immortals did not want to hear his talk.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiong Xin smiled: "Our Lady Star Constellation Immortal Venerable predicted that this would happen, she sent me here specially to find clues and information about Fang clan's traces. Once we find something, the anti- Fang alliance will be able to go all-out and eradicate Fang clan."</p>
<p>Wan Zi Hong, who was beside him, knew why Fang clan acted like this.</p>
<p>Some time ago, she had raised a suggestion to Star Constellation Immortal Venerable but the plan to recruit Fang clan was rejected. At that point, Wan Zi Hong knew that Fang clan had no way to surrender. Heavenly Court needed to intimidate everyone by showing a tough stance on this matter, in this situation, even she would react the same.</p>
<p>The anti-Fang alliance was too dragged on and slow in its movements, it gave Fang clan and Fang Yuan ample time to relocate their resources.</p>
<p>The best tactic of the anti-Fang alliance was to immediately attack Fang clan.</p>
<p>But they spent too much time discussing their internal affairs.</p>
<p>Negotiations took time after all, only after they finished distributing the supposed benefits did the anti-Fang alliance move out.</p>
<p>But Wan Zi Hong understood them.</p>
<p>If they did not do this, the anti-Fang alliance would not be able to send Gu Immortals out or come up with an appropriate tactic.</p>
<p>Risks and benefits were interlinked.</p>
<p>Only by confirming the benefit distribution would they be able to assign the clans to attack first and which ones to stay at the back, the entire anti-Fang alliance would have motivation to do this as well.</p>
<p>This alliance had been established for too short of a period, many of the Gu Immortals came from super forces that were not willing to take anyone's lead, there was nobody who could have sufficient authority or strength to take charge.</p>
<p>Without temptation, this anti-Fang alliance would not have even been able to form.</p>
<p>Like earlier, Wan clan had to pay out of their own pockets to lure the various super forces to send people and organize the anti-Fang alliance. After Wan Gu Chou was exposed, they used Fang clan's assets to tempt them.</p>
<p>Without any clear distribution of benefits, the anti-Fang alliance could not send anyone.</p>
<p>If battle broke out and Fang clan retaliated forcefully, the Gu Immortals would immediately retreat and protect themselves, without clear benefits, nobody would take any risk.</p>
<p>But Fang clan was forced into a corner, they were united at this moment.</p>
<p>In this situation, Fang clan was like a clenched fist while the anti-Fang alliance was like a pile of loose sand, it was likely that they would fail.</p>
<p>Thus, the process of negotiating benefits was a necessity.</p>
<p>"But my strength alone is not enough. Everyone, you should know about the threat that Fang clan poses, we need to get rid of these demonic path scoundrels as soon as possible. I would like you to send information path Gu Immortals to assist in pursuing them." Zhou Xiong Xin said.</p>
<p>"Fang clan is in the demonic path, they are no longer a righteous path super force, it is everyone's duty to eradicate them!" Western Desert's Gu Immortals nodded.</p>
<p>"But we returned with no gains from this, Wan clan and Heavenly Court have to give us a proper answer!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, indeed, in this situation, we can't leave empty handed, right?"</p>
<p>"If we leave without any gains, we will be too disappointed in you, Wan clan. If Fang clan attacks again, how can anyone come to support the anti- Fang alliance?"</p>
<p>The Gu Immortals went into a commotion again.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou felt a huge headache!</p>
<p>She thought about it and secretly transmitted to Xiao Ye Hu.</p>
<p>"Friend from Xiao clan, don't be anxious, my Wan clan will guarantee your benefits first."</p>
<p>"Accordingly, the first ancestor of Fang clan was the sole Gu Immortal in their clan. Back then, Fang clan occupied moving rock crevice and was the smallest super force in Western Desert.</p>
<p>"When the sand calamity appeared, Fang clan's first ancestor was faced with a choice. He could have created an immortal formation and sacrificed some Fang clan mortals to block the sand calamity. But he chose to protect Fang clan's people and left, giving up moving rock crevice in the process. Such an extreme nature is truly rare, but it is not hard to understand why he did that."</p>
<p>"Friend, you have captured many Fang clansmen, even though they are just from branch families, we can still make use of Fang clan's nature."</p>
<p>Xiao clan was the strongest super force besides Wan clan, Wan Gu Chou had to pacify them first.</p>
<p>Strength was the most important thing in a negotiation.</p>
<p>After getting Wan Gu Chou's assurance, Xiao Ye Hu's expression eased up and he stopped creating a scene.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou's words could be trusted, this was the attitude of the righteous path after all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if Wan Gu Chou disregarded her reputation and refused to pay, what could Xiao Ye Hu do?</p>
<p>"Sell! I will sell these Fang clansmen as slaves to humiliate Fang clan! We can also tamper with these people and use them to find out the location of Fang clan's immortals."</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu gritted his teeth and firmed up his mind.</p>
<p>A moment later, in treasure yellow heaven.</p>
<p>"Where, where is this?" Wang Xiao Er gasped.</p>
<p>The surrounding people were screaming in fear too, there was a loud commotion around them.</p>
<p>These people were floating in treasure yellow heaven, a formless force restrained them, keeping them in place together.</p>
<p>Thus, Wang Xiao Er felt horrible, he was not stepping on ground and he was surrounded by people, they were all squeezing around him.</p>
<p>"We were sold!"</p>
<p>"This is the legendary treasure yellow heaven."</p>
<p>Some knowledgeable Gu Masters explained the truth.</p>
<p>Fang clan's members had pale expressions.</p>
<p>This was the consequence of losing!</p>
<p>"Fang clan's Gu Immortals, listen to this. You have betrayed the righteous path and fallen into the demonic path, you are the shame of Western Desert's righteous path. Even if you ran away, you will still face our judgment!"</p>
<p>"These people are all members of Fang clan. They are innocent, but because of you, they are now slaves, this is all your fault."</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu's will entered treasure yellow heaven and spread the news, trying to humiliate Fang clan.</p>
<p>Such words made the Fang clansmen cry out in deeper anguish.</p>
<p>"Will anyone save us!"</p>
<p>"Lord ancestors, we are here."</p>
<p>"Why are you crying? Don't be a disgrace to Fang clan."</p>
<p>The best situation for them was to be bought by Fang clan's Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>Wang Xiao Er was among them, he shouted alongside the rest.</p>
<p>He was feeling very uneasy now.</p>
<p>He was treated as a Fang clan member because the situation was too chaotic earlier. Fang clan's members did not know that an external Gu Master was mixed among them.</p>
<p>Different from the rest, Wang Xiao Er did not want to be bought by Fang clan Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>Because the Fang clan Gu Immortals knew he was an outsider, not long ago, Fang Dong Xi had not just interrogated him roughly, he even used all sorts of vicious methods to torture Wang Xiao Er before healing him.</p>
<p>"Chaotic times are starting, Fang clan is a super force but it has actually gotten into this state."</p>
<p>"They courted death!"</p>
<p>"Fang clan definitely did not want to kill Wan clan's first supreme elder, they held back. In my opinion, Wan clan's first supreme elder was too useless, he actually died so easily."</p>
<p>"Right now, Wan clan is different. With Wan Gu Chou's revival, they will rise up to power again with such a legendary expert."</p>
<p>"Cooperating with Fang Yuan will give us Immortal Gu transactions. But working with Heavenly Court will allow us to revive Gu Immortals. They are both quite attractive!"</p>
<p>Fang clan's members were now slaves, this was a warning to many Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>The five regions chaotic war had not started, but the super forces had already started to destabilize.</p>
<p>At once, all of them felt varying emotions, Fang clan's predicament was also their concern for the future.</p>
<p>"How are you selling these human slaves?" Some people put up bids.</p>
<p>Human slaves were getting rarer and rarer, for the last hundred years, there were no such large scale human slave trade activities.</p>
<p>After all, capturing human enemies and selling them as slaves was an undeniable demonic act.</p>
<p>But right now, these Fang clan members had lost the battle, there was a proper excuse to sell them.</p>
