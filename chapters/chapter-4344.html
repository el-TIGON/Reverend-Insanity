    <h1>Chapter  2302</h1>
    <p>:  Contest  of  the  Three  Venerables</p>
<p>Again</p>
<p>“Where  am  I?”</p>
<p>“Who…  who  am  I?”</p>
<p>Fairy  Zi  Wei  woke  up  in  a  dream,  but  she  forgot  about  herself.</p>
<p>As  she  scanned  her  surroundings  in  a  daze,  she  saw  that  she  was  in  a  vast   desolate  yellow  plain  with  no  signs  of  life.</p>
<p>She  lowered  her  head  to  look  at  herself,  but  her  body  was  that  of  a  mudman.   She  had  short  hands  and  feet,  her  body  was  also  hard  and  dry.</p>
<p>“I  feel  like  I  have  forgotten  something  important.”</p>
<p>Fairy  Zi  Wei  frowned,  but  she  could  not  remember  no  matter  how  hard  she   tried.</p>
<p>She  even  forgot  if  that  important  thing  was  a  situation  or  a  person.</p>
<p>She  could  not  figure  it  out.</p>
<p>However,  this  bleak  yellow  land  gave  her  a  warm  feeling  of  closeness.</p>
<p>“Home?”  This  word  emerged  in  Fairy  Zi  Wei’s  mind.</p>
<p>But  this  desolate  home  made  her  feel  sad  as  well.</p>
<p>Wind  blew  over  at  this  time.</p>
<p>The  wind  got  increasingly  stronger,  blowing  the  soil  into  the  air.</p>
<p>Splash  splash  splash.</p>
<p>There  were  no  clouds  in  the  sky,  but  heavy  rain  started  to  fall.</p>
<p>Countless  bean-sized  raindrops  smashed  on  the  yellow  soil.</p>
<p>Soon,  a  large  marshy  land  was  formed.</p>
<p>Fairy  Zi  Wei  was  in  the  marsh,  her  whole  body  got  drenched  as  she  ended   up  in  a  miserable  state.</p>
<p>But  despite  the  wild  storm,  her  head  was  always  raised  and  her  vision  was   not  blocked  even  a  bit.</p>
<p>She  discovered  that  she  knew  everything  about  this  yellow  land.</p>
<p>She  also  had  a  feeling  that  she  could  control  this  storm,  it  seemed  to  be  as   simple  as  moving  her  fingers.</p>
<p>Hence,  she  thought  to  herself:  ”This  storm  is  too  big,  make  it  smaller.”</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  the  storm  really  became  smaller.</p>
<p>Hints  of  greenery  appeared  in  the  marsh  and  spread  everywhere.</p>
<p>These  were  the  young  shoots  of  weeds.</p>
<p>Fairy  Zi  Wei  felt  endless  joy  at  the  sight  of  these  weeds.</p>
<p>This  was  life.</p>
<p>Finally,  she  stopped  feeling  alone.</p>
<p>“Such  a  pity  that  they  grow  too  slowly,  it  will  be  better  if  they  grew  faster.”</p>
<p>The  weeds  began  to  grow  faster.</p>
<p>With  a  speed  visible  to  the  naked  eye,  the  emerging  greenery  began  to   flourish  and  spread.  The  grass  became  taller  and  covered  her  feet,  and  this   bleak  yellow  land  turned  into  a  grassland.</p>
<p>Some  sunken  areas  were  filled  with  rainwater  and  became  clear  ponds.</p>
<p>Fairy  Zi  Wei  moved  across  the  lush  grass  and  stood  beside  a  pond.  Her   image  was  reflected  on  the  water  surface  as  she  finally  saw  her  appearance.</p>
<p>She  was  a  clay  doll  made  of  purple  clay.  Her  eyes,  nose  and  mouth  were   drawn  with  golden  lines.</p>
<p>Fairy  Zi  Wei  suddenly  realized  her  identity.</p>
<p>“That’s  right,  I  am  this  blessed  land’s…  land  spirit.”</p>
<p>Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Below  star  array  calculation  formation,  outside  of  Embroidered  Tower.</p>
<p>“Bai  Qing  (Feng  Jin  Huang)  pays  respect  to  Lady  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable.”  A  pair  of  mother  and  daughter  greeted  respectfully.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  main  body  was  staying  inside   Embroidered  Tower.</p>
<p>She  did  not  invite  this  pair  of  mother  and  daughter  inside  Embroidered   Tower,  instead  she  used  an  information  path  mortal  Gu  to  show  a  video  in   the  space  outside  Embroidered  Tower.</p>
<p>After  the  video  showed  the  scene  of  those  heaven  path  dream  realms,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  spoke:  ”Feng  Jin  Huang,  have  you  seen   this  kind  of  dream  realm  before?”</p>
<p>Feng  Jin  Huang  had  been  watching  with  concentration,  she  replied:  ”Lady   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  junior  has  never  seen  this  kind  of   dream  realm.  But,  from  my  speculations,  the  present  dream  realms  can  be   divided  into  three  types  according  to  their  sources.  They  are  human  path,   beasts  and  plants,  as  well  as  heaven  path  dream  realms.”</p>
<p>“The  source  of  human  path  dream  realms  are  the  humans  or  variant   humans,  these  are  their  dreams.  The  source  of  beast  and  plant  dream  realms   are  those  beasts  and  plants  that  once  existed  or  are  still  living  now.  As  for   heaven  path  dream  realms,  the  source  is  heaven  and  earth  itself.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  nodded  slightly:  ”Good,  make  your   preparations.  I  will  need  you  to  go  to  spectral  heaven  to  explore  these   heaven  path  dream  realms  in  due  time.”</p>
<p>Feng  Jin  Huang,  however,  shook  her  head,  refusing  firmly:  ”Please  excuse   junior  for  being  unable  to  do  it.  Junior  is  only  a  mortal,  I  have  no   confidence  in  exploring  such  a  level  of  dream  realms,  and  also  have  no  way   to  guarantee  my  own  safety.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  brows  rose  slightly  as  she   had  not  expected  Feng  Jin  Huang  to  reject  her  so  directly.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  everyone  went  silent.</p>
<p>Fairy  Bai  Qing  was  stressed  out,  she  wanted  to  speak  but  could  not  say   anything  in  the  end.</p>
<p>She  felt  increasingly  suffocated.</p>
<p>Feng  Jin  Huang  still  had  an  indifferent  expression,  seemingly  not  feeling   any  pressure.</p>
<p>“Alright.  You  may  both  leave.”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   spoke  after  a  long  while.</p>
<p>“Junior  takes  her  leave.”  Feng  Jin  Huang  bowed  towards  Embroidered   Tower  and  left.</p>
<p>Looking  at  the  receding  figures  of  the  two,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  sighed  lightly  with  a  complicated  gaze.</p>
<p>Ying  Wu  Xie  was  swallowed  by  a  heaven  path  dream  realm,  this  was  really   unfortunate.</p>
<p>He  was  a  great  pawn  to  deal  with  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  but  was   gotten  rid  of  by  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>The  dream  realm  could  not  be  explored,  that  meant  that  Ying  Wu  Xie  was   done  for.</p>
<p>Feng  Jin  Huang’s  opinion  about  heaven  path  and  human  path  dream  realms   verified  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  own  ideas.  But  Feng  Jin   Huang  was  indeed  only  a  Gu  Master  and  not  a  Gu  Immortal,  it  was  natural   for  her  to  be  unable  to  do  anything  to  these  dream  realms.</p>
<p>“I  cannot  conceal  these  heaven  path  dream  realms,  it  is  only  a  matter  of   time  for  the  other  two  venerables  to  know  of  them.  The  contest  of  three   venerables  may  start  once  again.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  worried.</p>
<p>Because  this  was  much  more  complicated  than  before.</p>
<p>Black  and  white  heaven  were  gone,  only  spectral  heaven  remained.</p>
<p>Spectral  heaven  was  the  territory  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>What  would  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  do  if  venerables  were  to  barge   into  his  territory?</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  had  lost  his  sanity  and  was  filled  with   heaven’s  will,  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  were  also  the  same.  What   connection  did  these  two  have?  Would  they  help  each  other?</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  weak  before;  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  had  no  worries.</p>
<p>But  now  was  different.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  had  resonated  with  rank  nine  fire  Gu,  and   his  soul  foundation  had  surged  to  a  terrifying  level  after  slaughtering   billions  of  living  beings  in  the  two  heavens.</p>
<p>If  a  conflict  occurred  between  the  venerables  because  of  the  heaven  path   dream  realms,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  likely  to  participate  and   would  be  an  opponent  that  could  not  be  neglected.</p>
<p>After  pondering  over  it,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  decided  to   slow  down  in  refining  Central  Continent’s  wisdom  path  dao  marks,  she  had   to  save  her  immortal  essence  for  the  battle.</p>
<p>Her  intention  to  get  rid  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  became  firmer  as   time  passed.</p>
<p>“Since  Ying  Wu  Xie  is  gone,  I  need  to  make  proper  use  of  Bo  Qing.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  decided  to  create  a  powerful  Spectral   Soul  clone.</p>
<p>The  risk  was  high  though,  after  all,  tampering  with  the  soul  was  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  forte.</p>
<p>Fairy  Maiden  Soul’s  action  was  tantamount  to  showing  off  in  front  of  an   expert.</p>
<p>But  the  situation  forced  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  hand,  she   could  not  afford  to  care  about  this.</p>
<p>Bo  Qing’s  soul  was  filled  with  sword  path  dao  marks  which  must  be  paired   with  a  sword  path  Gu  Immortal  body.  This  body  should  contain  an  immortal   aperture,  and  the  higher  its  cultivation  level,  the  better.</p>
<p>However,  even  looking  at  the  whole  world,  there  were  not  many  Gu   Immortals  who  cultivated  sword  path.</p>
<p>There  were  a  few  in  Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects,  but  they   were  all  at  rank  seven.</p>
<p>In  the  whole  five  regions,  there  was  no  rank  eight  lone  and  demonic   cultivator  who  cultivated  sword  path.  In  fact,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  deductions  showed  that  there  was  only  one  rank  eight  sword   path  Gu  Immortal  currently.</p>
<p>“Western  Desert  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder?”  Prince  Feng  Xian,  Red   Heart  Traveler,  and  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  showed  strange  expressions.</p>
<p>“Heavenly  Court  needs  his  immortal  aperture  and  body,  this  is  related  to  the   contest  of  venerables  and  the  safety  of  the  world.”  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  voice  was  clear  and  cold.</p>
<p>The  three  immortals  looked  at  each  other  before  responding  resolutely:   ”Please  give  us  your  command.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  transmitted  her  instructions  to  them,   as  well  as  how  they  should  cooperate  with  Wan  Zi  Hong  and  Zhou  Xiong   Xin.</p>
<p>The  three  immortals’  gaze  shone  sharply  as  they  heard  the  plan  and  left   with  great  confidence.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  silent  for  a  while,  she  then   contacted  the  Genesis  Lotus’  will  in  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Genesis  Lotus’  will  had  been  overseeing  Divine  Emperor  City,  but  through   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  method,  it  expanded  and  split  a   portion  to  stay  in  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>This  portion  of  Genesis  Lotus’  will  in  Heavenly  Court  had  one  main  task,   that  was  to  nourish  Cang  Xuan  Zi.</p>
<p>Cang  Xuan  Zi  was  a  legendary  immemorial  beast,  it  was  a  huge  vine  that   connected  heaven  and  earth.</p>
<p>It  sprouted  in  three  hundred  years,  blossomed  in  three  hundred  years,  and   bore  fruits  in  three  hundred  years.  The  fruits  that  it  created  were  called  vast   heaven  fruits,  if  used  in  a  grotto-heaven,  it  could  expand  the  size  of  the   immortal  aperture’s  sky.  Thus,  this  vast  heaven  vine  was  also  known  as  the   tenth  heaven  of  this  world!</p>
<p>It  entered  Heavenly  Court  after  an  agreement  with  Genesis  Lotus  Immortal   Venerable.  It  was  an  unique  existence  in  Heavenly  Court,  it  did  not  need  to   follow  orders,  and  only  had  to  provide  a  batch  of  vast  heaven  fruits  every   thousand  years.</p>
<p>But  in  the  fate  war,  it  was  killed  by  Fang  Yuan’s  time  cutting  edge.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  have  any  methods  to  revive   it,  but  Genesis  Lotus’  will  that  originated  from  Genesis  Lotus  Immortal   Venerable  had  methods  to  revive  Cang  Xuan  Zi!</p>
<p>“Cang  Xuan  Zi’s  death  is  actually  beneficial  to  Heavenly  Court.”  Genesis   Lotus’  will  communicated  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>“In  a  hundred  or  so  days,  Cang  Xuan  Zi’s  body  will  be  restored.  At  that   time,  I  will  enter  and  control  this  body,  supplying  a  legendary  immemorial   beast’s  battle  strength  to  Heavenly  Court!”</p>
<p>“An  even  more  amazing  thing  is  that  the  fruits  produced  by  Cang  Xuan  Zi   will  contain  my  will.  Using  these  fruits  to  reforge  Heavenly  Court  will</p>
<p>isolate  us  from  heaven’s  will.”</p>
<p>“There  will  be  a  new  Heavenly  Court  in  the  future,  our  gains  from  the   derivation  formation  will  belong  to  us  and  not  be  known  by  heaven’s  will.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  nodded:  ”This  is  a  long-term  plan   and  not  an  urgent  matter.  Have  you  remembered  anything  else  regarding  the   revival  of  Genesis  Lotus  Immortal  Venerable?”</p>
<p>Genesis  Lotus’  will  shook  its  head:  ”I  know  very  little  about  the  revival   plan  set  by  my  main  body.  I  only  know  that  he  left  behind  a  self-portrait   from  which  he  can  revive.  But  I  have  no  idea  where  this  self-portrait  is.”</p>
<p>“How  about  you,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable?  You  are  Senior   Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  disciple,  don’t  you  know  his   revival  plan?”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  heaved  a  sigh:  ”Truth  be  said,  master   told  me  he  left  behind  two  revival  methods  just  in  case.  The  first  revival   method  was  Heavenly  Court’s  qi  harvest  fruit.  However,  that  Fang  Yuan   took  it  before  this  fruit  could  ripen.  The  second  method  involves  the   Primordial  Origin  Treasury.”</p>
<p>“Primordial  Origin  Treasury?”</p>
<p>“Primordial  Origin  Treasury  was  secretly  created  by  master  to  store  the   large  number  of  rank  eight  immortal  essence  stones  produced  by  Yi  Qi  Zi   back  then.  The  treasury  also  has  master’s  arrangements  for  revival.  But  I   have  no  way  to  look  for  it.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  said  that  she  has  no  way  to  look  for   it,  and  not  that  she  had  no  clues.</p>
<p>In  fact,  she  had  related  clues  of  both  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable   and  Genesis  Lotus  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival  methods.  Moreover,  she   already  knew  they  were  in  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>But  she  could  not  inspect  or  probe  it.</p>
<p>Because  it  would  then  be  discovered  by  other  venerables.</p>
<p>With  the  revival  of  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  the  other   venerables  were  definitely  on  guard  against  the  revival  of  other  Heavenly   Court  venerables.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  needed  to  refine  all  the  wisdom  path   dao  marks  in  Central  Continent  before  she  could  conceal  these  revival  plans   and  not  be  afraid  of  other  venerables’  inspection.</p>
<p>Even  if  other  venerables  saw  through  it,  she  could  use  her  terrain  advantage   in  Central  Continent  to  resist  the  attacks  of  the  venerables  and  protect   Heavenly  Court  venerables’  revival  methods.</p>
<p>Only  after  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  refined  all  the  wisdom   path  dao  marks  in  Central  Continent  could  she  start  reviving  other  Heavenly   Court  venerables.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  foundation  was  unfathomably  deep.</p>
<p>Once  the  two  venerables  revived,  they  would  rule  the  world  once  again.</p>
<p>After  all,  the  combined  strength  of  three  venerables  was  unthinkable.  They   would  easily  surpass  the  individual  strength  of  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  and  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Even  if  Giant  Sun,  Fang  Yuan,  and  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  allied,   they  would  be  weaker  than  Heavenly  Court’s  three  venerables.</p>
<p>It  was  because  of  the  difference  in  their  ideals!</p>
<p>But  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  appeared  which  delayed  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  plan  once  again.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  needed  to  slow  down  on  refining  dao   marks,  and  save  her  immortal  essence  to  prepare  for  the  battle  between   venerables!</p>
<p>Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  sighed.</p>
<p>He  did  his  best,  but  after  absorbing  rank  eight  immortal  essence  stones,  the   converted  immortal  essence  was  only  seventy  percent  of  the  immortal   essence  stones.</p>
<p>And  this  seventy  percent  immortal  essence  was  only  rank  eight  immortal   essence.</p>
<p>“I  need  to  get  rid  of  the  heaven’s  will,  but  I  don’t  cultivate  wisdom  path.  I   also  lack  crucial  luck  path  Immortal  Gu.”</p>
<p>“Maybe  I  can  transact  with  Fang  Yuan?”</p>
<p>“No,  I  can’t  reveal  any  clues  about  this.”</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>“Heaven  path  dream  realms?  Good!  Very  good.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  been  planning  to  create  a  heaven  path  venerable  clone  not   long  ago,  he  was  just  worried  about  his  lacking  heaven  path  attainment   level  when  heaven  path  dream  realms  appeared!</p>
<p>It  was  just  that  seizing  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  would  probably  incite   another  battle  between  venerables.</p>
<p>“It  is  better  to  refine  another  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  to  help  me  raise  my   direct  combat  strength.”</p>
