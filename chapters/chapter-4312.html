        <p>:  Derivation’s  Immortal  Might</p>
<p>The  shocking  change  to  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  who  was  inside  the   two  heavens  ruined  the  plans  of  the  venerables  again.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  raised  his  head  and  used  his  investigative  killer  move.</p>
<p>He  saw  that  the  icy  flame  had  covered  half  of  the  immemorial  two  heavens,   everywhere  it  went,  all  life  was  extinguished.  Even  immemorial  desolate   beasts  could  not  last  long.</p>
<p>This  was  definitely  a  slaughter.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  benefited  greatly  from  this,  his  entire  body   had  grown  to  a  hundred  times  of  when  he  was  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave!  He   had  over  ten  thousand  black  pillar-like  arms  now.</p>
<p>His  terrifying  aura  and  killing  intent  permeated  the  entire  heaven.</p>
<p>Although  he  was  motionless  in  the  two  heavens,  he  took  the  role  of  the  old   sun  of  white  heaven,  he  was  now  the  absolute  overlord  of  the  night  sky.</p>
<p>“Feng  Jiu  Ge…”  Fang  Yuan’s  gaze  was  deep.</p>
<p>He  had  already  found  out  that  the  cause  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable’s  huge  change  was  Feng  Jiu  Ge.</p>
<p>Ever  since  the  fate  war,  Feng  Jiu  Ge  had  betrayed  Heavenly  Court  and  gone   missing.</p>
<p>To  think  that  the  next  time  he  showed  up,  he  did  such  a  shocking  thing.</p>
<p>But  the  suspicious  thing  to  Fang  Yuan  was  that  Feng  Jiu  Ge  seemed  to  still   have  his  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength!</p>
<p>This  was  the  only  explanation  for  how  he  could  quickly  affect  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable  and  escape  successfully.</p>
<p>Be  it  Fang  Yuan,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  or  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable,  they  could  not  use  their  investigative  method  on   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  all  the  time.  This  required  thoughts  and   immortal  essence.</p>
<p>That  was  also  why  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  created  the  star   array  calculation  formation,  it  helped  her  to  monitor  the  whole  of  Central   Continent.</p>
<p>“Destiny  song…”</p>
<p>“It  is  able  to  allow  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  the  wild  fire  Gu  to   coexist,  achieving  harmony.  Feng  Jiu  Ge’s  killer  move  has  gotten  stronger.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  now  a  refinement  path  venerable.</p>
<p>In  the  entire  world,  aside  from  the  venerables,  Feng  Jiu  Ge  was  the  number   one  person  who  deserved  Fang  Yuan’s  attention  the  most!</p>
<p>This  person’s  talent  was  shocking  to  the  world,  he  was  even  Feng  Jin   Huang’s  father.</p>
<p>In  the  five  hundred  years  of  Fang  Yuan’s  previous  life,  Feng  Jiu  Ge  was   plotted  against  by  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  died  while  attacking</p>
<p>Lang  Ya  blessed  land.</p>
<p>Now  that  Fang  Yuan  thought  about  it,  he  could  see  that  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable  had  also  paid  a  lot  of  attention  to  Feng  Jiu  Ge!</p>
<p>Precisely  because  of  this,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  plotted  and  killed   Feng  Jiu  Ge.  Otherwise,  during  those  five  hundred  years,  he  would  have   created  his  own  legend  and  shone  brightly  like  the  stars.</p>
<p>The  weird  thing  was  that  although  Spectral  Soul  plotted  to  kill  Feng  Jiu  Ge   in  that  life,  currently,  Feng  Jiu  Ge  seemed  to  be  helping  the  former  instead!</p>
<p>“So,  is  the  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength  that  Feng  Jiu  Ge  possesses  a   result  of  future  self  or  did  he  cultivate  himself  during  this  period  of  time?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  pondered  deeply.</p>
<p>This  was  a  crucial  question.</p>
<p>If  Feng  Jiu  Ge  still  had  future  self  killer  move,  that  meant  that  he  still  had  a   close  connection  to  Red  Lotus  Demon  Venerable!</p>
<p>In  that  case,  the  person  behind  Feng  Jiu  Ge  would  be  Red  Lotus  Demon   Venerable,  meaning  he  was  plotting  from  behind  the  scenes.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  about  the  relationship  between  these  two.</p>
<p>Back  then,  after  he  failed  and  was  reborn,  in  order  to  destroy  fate  Gu,  he   gave  crucial  intel  to  Feng  Jiu  Ge  and  allowed  him  to  get  his  own  Red  Lotus   true  inheritance.</p>
<p>Why  was  Feng  Jiu  Ge  helping  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable?  There  was   also  Heavenly  Court’s  attitude  towards  him  that  Fang  Yuan  had  to  consider   now.</p>
<p>Right  now,  Fang  Yuan  knew  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had   sent  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  to  hunt  down  the  remnants  of  Shadow   Sect  like  Fairy  Zi  Wei.  Then,  why  was  Star  Constellation  Immortal</p>
<p>Venerable  not  going  after  Feng  Jiu  Ge?  Why  did  they  leave  Feng  Jin  Huang   alone,  as  if  they  forgot  about  her?</p>
<p>What  was  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  planning?</p>
<p>Spring  Autumn  Cicada  could  not  be  used  anymore,  while  Fang  Yuan  did   not  know  of  many  secrets  and  hidden  information  now.</p>
<p>And  because  he  lacked  effective  investigative  methods  that  could  be  used   on  the  venerables,  he  had  to  pretend  to  be  weak  and  only  make  guesses   blindly.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  already  healed,  after  leaving   Heavenly  Court,  she  had  been  refining  Central  Continent’s  wisdom  path   dao  marks  these  days.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  she  was  making  deductions.</p>
<p>“Feng  Jiu  Ge…  destiny  song…”</p>
<p>“I  cultivate  wisdom  path  which  controls  certainty.  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  cultivates  luck  path  which  explores  uncertainty.  This  destiny   song  actually  contains  both  certainty  and  uncertainty,  it  involves  heaven   path  and  human  path!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  recalled  her  own  experiences,   throughout  humanity’s  history,  or  even  the  variant  human’s  history,  in  terms   of  pure  talent,  Feng  Jiu  Ge  was  definitely  top  ten.</p>
<p>“Feng  Jiu  Ge  met  with  Fairy  Zi  Wei  and  the  rest,  he  might  have  helped   them.  Right  now,  he  helped  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  these  actions   will  greatly  benefit  his  destiny  song  killer  move.”</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  pursuers  failed.</p>
<p>They  could  not  bring  back  Fairy  Zi  Wei  and  the  rest.</p>
<p>But  through  the  traces  left  behind,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   managed  to  deduce  many  details  of  the  truth.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  inside  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Derivation  formation  was  currently  in  operation.</p>
<p>Che  Wei  and  several  other  Gu  Immortals  stood  before  the  formation  and   waited.</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  had  left  Heavenly  Court  already,  their   memories  regarding  this  were  deleted.</p>
<p>This  was  done  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  personally,  she  did   not  remove  their  memories  carelessly,  she  had  altered  them  meticulously.</p>
<p>In  the  following  period,  these  ten  children  of  human  path  would  have  bursts   of  ’inspiration’  which  would  allow  them  to  ’create’  the  respective  Gu   recipes.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  a  vigilant  person,  but  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   was  even  more  vigilant  when  it  came  to  this.</p>
<p>She  did  the  same  to  anyone  who  had  come  into  contact  with  the  derivation   formation.</p>
<p>In  this  case,  as  long  as  one  did  not  have  higher  wisdom  path  attainment  than   her,  they  would  not  be  able  to  gain  intel  about  the  derivation  formation  from   the  ten  children  of  human  path.</p>
<p>The  derivation  formation  was  too  important  to  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  to  think  of  ways  to  protect  this   secret  to  the  best  of  her  abilities!</p>
<p>Ruan  Dan  flew  out  from  the  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>Che  Wei  and  the  rest  quickly  went  up  and  asked  for  the  results.</p>
<p>Ruan  Dan’s  expression  soon  went  back  to  normal,  it  was  extremely  excited:   ”Amazing,  this  derivation  formation  is  too  amazing!  I  obtained  over  a   thousand  pill  path  Gu  recipes,  among  which  are  a  hundred  Immortal  Gu   recipes!  I’ve  tried  to  create  pill  path  killer  moves  for  so  long  without  much   progress,  but  now,  I  obtained  more  than  two  hundred  killer  moves,  among   which,  there  are  over  fifty  immortal  killer  moves!!”</p>
<p>Che  Wei  and  the  rest  were  shook.</p>
<p>Ruan  Dan  was  the  first  to  enter  the  formation,  to  think  that  the  gains  would   be  so  immense!</p>
<p>Different  from  the  ten  children  of  human  path,  Ruan  Dan  was  a  legendary   immemorial  desolate  beast,  it  had  a  long  lifespan  and  countless  experiences,   its  foundation  was  very  deep.</p>
<p>“Friend  Ruan  Dan,  although  you  created  pill  path,  you  do  not  know  much   about  other  paths.  With  this  derivation  formation,  you  can  come  into  contact   with  the  research  results  of  other  paths  by  using  pill  path  as  the  core.  After   creating  a  resonance,  countless  new  results  would  be  derived,  thus,  your   gains  were  so  immense!”  Feng  Da  Qi  analyzed.</p>
<p>She  was  a  Gu  Immortal  of  Heavenly  Lotus  Sect,  this  time,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  chosen  her  to  become  one  of  the   people  entering  the  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>Ruan  Dan  nodded  in  agreement:  ”Fairy  Feng  is  right.  For  a  brand  new  path   like  pill  path,  the  first  step  of  development  is  to  popularize  it.  After  many   generations  of  Gu  cultivators  come  into  contact  and  cultivate  it,  through   their  various  life  experiences  and  perspectives,  they  will  slowly  build  pill   path  with  their  unique  ideas.”</p>
<p>“After  that,  more  and  more  cultivators  will  emerge,  among  which,  geniuses   will  create  new  advancements  and  breakthrough,  obtaining  huge  research   results.”</p>
<p>“But  now,  the  derivation  formation  has  taken  the  place  of  all  these  steps.   Using  all  sorts  of  exceptional  Gu  Immortal  inheritances,  the  historical</p>
<p>characters  are  helping  us  in  this  development.  In  just  a  short  period  of  time,   we  can  accumulate  a  vast  amount  of  pill  path  foundation.”</p>
<p>After  hearing  the  analysis,  Che  Wei  and  the  rest  had  increasingly  heated   gazes.</p>
<p>“I  will  go  next.”  Che  Wei  was  the  second  person  to  enter  the  formation.</p>
<p>Several  days  later,  he  came  out.</p>
<p>His  gains  were  as  huge  as  Ruan  Dan!</p>
<p>The  immortals  continued  their  analysis.</p>
<p>Ruan  Dan  said:  ”Friend  Che  Wei,  although  you  have  only  created  weapon   path  for  a  short  time  unlike  me,  you  are  a  purebred  human  with  the   strongest  spirituality.  Therefore,  your  gains  are  equal  to  mine.  If  you  had   created  this  path  for  a  longer  time,  your  gains  will  even  exceed  mine.”</p>
<p>Che  Wei  shook  his  head  in  response:  ”I  do  not  agree  with  this  conjecture.”</p>
<p>“Any  path  that  reaches  grandmaster  attainment  can  learn  about  any  path   using  their  own  as  a  foundation.  Through  their  path,  they  can  mimic  the   expertise  of  other  paths.  For  example,  one  can  use  fire  path  Gu  worms  to   create  a  move  with  water  path  abilities.”</p>
<p>“The  derivation  formation  might  be  a  forceful  type  of  mimicry.”</p>
<p>“The  vast  number  of  true  inheritances  stored  in  the  immortal  formation   were  described  through  Ruan  Dan’s  pill  path  and  my  weapon  path.  For   example,  the  iron  rod  Gu  recipe  that  I  obtained  is  the  result  of  converting   metal  path  into  weapon  path.  There  is  also  leather  whip  Gu  which  is  the   resulting  derivation  by  combining  transformation  path  and  weapon  path.”</p>
<p>Che  Wei’s  words  made  the  immortals’  understanding  of  derivation   formation  deepen  again.</p>
<p>It  was  Feng  Da  Qi’s  turn.</p>
<p>She  only  had  rank  seven  cultivation  level  but  was  Genesis  Lotus  Immortal   Venerable’s  bloodline  descendant.</p>
<p>After  entering  the  formation,  she  only  spent  a  day  and  night  before  getting   out.</p>
<p>After  returning,  she  had  a  smile  on  her  face.</p>
<p>“I’ve  obtained  painting  path  research  results,  next,  I  will  refine  painting   path  Immortal  Gu  and  change  my  vital  Gu  to  painting  path.”</p>
<p>The  immortals  congratulated  her.</p>
<p>The  use  of  the  derivation  formation  was  not  just  to  help  develop  human   path,  pill  path,  and  weapon  path,  it  could  also  extract  the  specific  essence  of   the  various  paths  to  create  new  branches  of  an  existing  path.</p>
<p>Genesis  Lotus  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  leave  any  painting  path   inheritance  for  his  descendants.</p>
<p>But  through  the  derivation  formation,  Heavenly  Court  could  directly   nurture  their  own  painting  path  Gu  Immortals!</p>
<p>Gu  are  the  essence  of  heaven  and  earth,  man  is  the  spirit  of  all  living  beings.</p>
<p>There  was  no  point  in  discussing  the  strongest  Gu  worm,  only  the  strongest   Gu  Immortal  mattered.</p>
<p>The  way  of  Gu  involved  nurturing,  use  and  refinement,  these  were  all   integral.</p>
<p>Limitless  Demon  Venerable  used  rank  nine  derivation  Immortal  Gu  and   other  cores  to  create  his  Crazed  Demon  formation.</p>
<p>He  created  the  truthful  floating  ice  and  tried  to  utilize  his  eternal  life   research  results  but  failed  in  the  end,  more  than  half  of  the  truthful  floating   ice  was  lost.  The  remaining  portion  was  split  into  three  by  Fang  Yuan  and   the  two  venerables.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  used  derivation  Immortal  Gu  to   create  the  derivation  formation,  allowing  the  various  paths  to  develop   rapidly.  A  vast  amount  of  research  results  were  produced,  saving  a  lot  of   time  and  also  preventing  these  results  from  leaking  to  the  outside  world,   which  was  a  huge  drawback  of  development.</p>
<p>If  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  such  a  method,  he  would  not  have   needed  to  make  his  Blood  Sea  clone  distribute  blood  path  inheritances   worldwide.</p>
