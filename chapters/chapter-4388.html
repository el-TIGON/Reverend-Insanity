    <p>:  Primordial  Origin’s  Grand  Revival  Plan</p>
<p>“Do  what  you  want.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  words  almost  froze  the  atmosphere   between  the  two  venerables.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  could  not  help  but  laugh  in  ridicule:  ”Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable,  you  are  truly  the  Immortal  King  of  Heavenly  Court,   this  is  truly  the  number  one  super  force,  the  leader  of  humanity  —   Heavenly  Court!”</p>
<p>His  eyes  narrowed  as  his  expression  turned  solemn:  ”This  is  not  normal,   even  if  it  was  just  for  my  mere  clone,  even  if  this  is  Qi  Sea…  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  what  is  your  true  intention?!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  speak,  her  figure  flashed  like   starlight  and  disappeared  from  the  entrance.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  expression  was  dark  and  his  eyes  shone  coldly  as  some  anxiety   showed  itself  on  his  face.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  turned  around  and  flew  down  from  spectral  heaven,  arriving  in   Central  Continent  and  entering  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>He  was  trying  to  take  the  Heavenly  Court  members  as  captives  but  these  Gu   Immortals  had  already  suicided.</p>
<p>They  could  revive  in  Heavenly  Court’s  immortal  graveyard.</p>
<p>With  the  destruction  of  fate  Gu,  there  was  a  huge  potential  in  the  method  of   suicide  and  revival.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  complete  methods.  On  one  hand,  the  Gu  Immortals  had   phantom  apertures,  when  they  died,  the  phantom  apertures  returned,  their   losses  were  minimized.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  Gu  Immortals   suicided,  their  Immortal  Gu  could  be  transferred  through  treasure  yellow   heaven.</p>
<p>Now,  this  had  already  become  a  mature  and  excellent  battle  tactic  of   Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Under  the  same  cultivation  level,  stopping  a  Gu  Immortal  from  escaping   was  extremely  difficult.  At  the  very  least,  one  needed  immortal  formations   or  immortal  battlefield  killer  moves  to  trap  the  target.</p>
<p>To  prevent  a  Gu  Immortal  from  suiciding  was  much  more  difficult  than   stopping  them  from  escaping.</p>
<p>What  could  they  do  about  if  the  other  wanted  to  die?</p>
<p>But,  with  Zhan  Bu  Du  and  Wu  Shuai  pinning  them  down,  some  Gu   Immortals  were  still  stuck  in  the  battle.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  main  body  descended,  bringing  complete  despair  to  these   Central  Continent  Gu  Immortals.  He  directly  waved  his  sleeve  and   suppressed  all  of  these  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>He  did  not  kill  them  and  only  took  them  as  captives.</p>
<p>He  captured  over  ten  Central  Continent  Gu  Immortals  but  there  was  not   even  one  member  of  Heavenly  Court;  naturally,  these  captives  included  Li   Xiao  Bai.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  show   any  movement,  Fang  Yuan’s  expression  became  increasingly  unsightly.</p>
<p>He  thought  for  a  bit  and  flew  towards  Fei  He  Mountain.</p>
<p>Central  Continent’s  Fei  He  Mountain  was  the  base  of  Immortal  Crane  Sect,   this  mountain  was  not  only  a  super  resource  point,  the  public  blessed  land   of  Immortal  Crane  Sect  was  also  located  on  it.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  currently  at  the  center  of  the  star  array  calculation  formation   and  the  nearest  super  force  was  Immortal  Crane  Sect.</p>
<p>But  when  he  arrived  at  the  location  of  Fei  He  Mountain,  this  floating   mountain  range  had  disappeared.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  expression  turned  darker,  he  then  moved  northwest  towards   Myriad  Dragon  Dock.</p>
<p>Myriad  Dragon  Dock  was  the  same  as  Immortal  Crane  Sect,  both  belonged   to  the  ten  great  ancient  sects  of  Central  Continent.  Myriad  Dragon  Dock’s   headquarters  blessed  land  was  on  the  island  at  the  heart  of  dragon  lake.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  arrived  here,  dragon  lake  and  the  central  island  were  still  around   but  the  public  blessed  land  was  empty.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  went  to  Heavenly  Lotus  Sect,  Spirit  Butterfly  Valley,  Ancient   Soul  Sect,  Heaven’s  Envy  Manor,  Wind  Cloud  Manor,  Combat  Immortal   Sect,  Spirit  Affinity  House,  and  Black  Heaven  Temple,  but  all  their   headquarters  were  empty.</p>
<p>Clearly,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  already  planned  to  give   up  on  Central  Continent  and  had  made  sufficient  preparations  to  bring  away   the  sect  members.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Within  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  mind.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  could  not  move,  his  thoughts  were  also  being  suppressed   by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  method.</p>
<p>But  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  put  up  his  final  resistance  with  the  remaining  will  in   his  mind:  ”Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  you  are  really  a  good   schemer.”</p>
<p>During  this  period  of  imprisonment,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  already  understood   the  situation.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  sword  qi  killer  move  was  extremely  effective  on  him;  first,   it  was  because  the  sword  qi  was  concealed  and  also  had  qi  path  dao  marks,   Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  not  able  to  detect  it  with  the  vast  qi  currents   surrounding  him  at  that  time.</p>
<p>But  analyzing  the  situation  deeper,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  certain  that  the   main  culprit  ware  the  sword  path  dao  marks!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sensed  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  thoughts   and  said:  ”You  are  not  wrong,  Lin  Jian  Xing  is  different  from  others,  he  is   an  otherworldly  demon  and  in  history,  otherworldly  demons  carry   otherworldly  dao  marks.”</p>
<p>“Thieving  Heaven  Demon  Venerable  had  otherworldly  space  path  dao   marks  so  his  Thieving  Heaven’s  true  inheritance  space  could  block  the   future  venerables.  In  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  when  the  hole  of  chaos   appeared,  Thieving  Heaven  used  his  otherworldly  space  path  dao  marks  as   the  main  force  to  seal  it.”</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  understood  at  once:  ”So  Lin  Jian  Xing  has  otherworldly   sword  path  dao  marks.  This  move  is  probably  effective  against  even   venerables,  isn’t  it  too  much  of  a  waste  to  use  it  on  a  clone  like  me?”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  then  told  the  truth  of  the  qi  harvest   fruit  and  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea’s  will  shook  fiercely:  ”So  it  was  like  this!  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable,  you  already  planned  a  trap  when  you  set  up  the  star   array  calculation  formation.  Later,  you  used  heaven  path  dream  realms  to   create  an  environment  to  lure  me  into  attacking  the  star  array  calculation   formation.  We  actually  fell  for  it!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable:  ”As  a  wisdom  path  Gu  Immortal,  I   naturally  researched  deeply  into  Fang  Yuan’s  personality.  Moreover,  you  are</p>
<p>are  his  most  capable  clone,  there  was  a  high  chance  you  would  be  sent  to   attack  the  star  array  calculation  formation.”</p>
<p>Qi  Sea’s  will  sneered:  ”In  that  case,  even  though  you  went  through  such  an   elaborate  charade  to  capture  and  imprison  me,  did  you  manage  to  deduce   my  main  body’s  actions?  Your  Central  Continent  is  done  for!  Hahaha.  It  is   such  a  regret,  if  you  had  refined  all  of  the  wisdom  path  dao  marks  of   Central  Continent,  you  might  have  had  a  chance  to  block  my  main  body.  A   pity,  a  pity.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  tone  became  quiet  and  heavy:  ”My   Heavenly  Court  is  the  leader  of  the  righteous  path,  over  three  million  years   had  passed  since  it  was  established.  Since  then,  countless  Heavenly  Court   Gu  Immortals  had  sacrificed  themselves  to  protect  the  righteous  path  and   the  whole  of  humanity.”</p>
<p>“In  the  present  situation,  many  venerables  are  confronting  each  other  in   utter  chaos,  it  is  much  more  terrifying  and  severe  than  when  variant  humans   dominated  the  world  in  the  Immemorial  Antiquity  Era.”</p>
<p>“Central  Continent  is  bordered  with  four  regions,  I,  Star  Constellation,  am   starting  to  feel  powerless  after  confronting  the  other  venerables  for  so  long.   Right  now,  I  can  only  pay  attention  to  the  key  aspects  and  guard  the  overall   situation.”</p>
<p>“Since  I  made  such  a  plan,  I  obviously  know  what  Fang  Yuan’s  reaction   will  be.  The  plan  succeeded  now,  so  the  common  people  of  my  Central   Continent  and  countless  living  beings  are  facing  Fang  Yuan’s  terrifying   revenge!”</p>
<p>“However…”</p>
<p>“As  long  as  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  revives  from  this,  my   Heavenly  Court  will  have  two  venerables,  the  situation  of  the  five  regions   will  definitely  undergo  a  great  change.”</p>
<p>“Everyone  knows  that  the  demonic  path  is  unrestrained  and  runs  amok,  but   they  do  not  know  that  it  takes  even  more  courage  and  sense  of</p>
<p>responsibility  to  defend  the  righteous  path!”</p>
<p>“I,  Star  Constellation,  have  sinned  to  create  an  advantage  for  the  righteous   path.  I  am  sinful  for  sacrificing  countless  people!”</p>
<p>“But  I  am  willing  to  bear  this  heavy  sin  to  create  more  hope  for  the  future,   for  humanity,  and  for  the  righteous  path.”</p>
<p>“In  fact,  Divine  Emperor  City  has  already  stored  the  records  of  various   human  qi  in  it.  By  cooperating  with  Heavenly  Court’s  immortal  graveyard,   we  will  be  capable  of  using  more  revival  methods.”</p>
<p>“I  solemnly  swear  now,  regardless  of  how  many  humans  Fang  Yuan   slaughters  today,  as  long  as  I  have  a  trace  of  strength  left  in  the  future,  I  will   do  everything  I  can  to  revive  them!  If  I  fail  to  keep  my  word,  then  I,  Star   Constellation,  am  not  fit  to  be  human!!”</p>
<p>These  words  stupefied  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.</p>
<p>Even  as  her  enemy,  he  could  not  help  but  admire  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  resolve,  sense  of  responsibility,  and  decisiveness.</p>
<p>“Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable!”</p>
<p>“Sob,  sob…  we  were  too  shallow,  we  even  resented  you  before.”</p>
<p>“Everything  is  for  righteousness!”</p>
<p>“How  can  we  compromise  because  of  Demon  Venerable’s  threat  and   revenge?  This  is  not  kindness  but  a  form  of  weakness!”</p>
<p>“Right,  if  we  compromise  this  time,  we  will  do  it  again  and  again  in  the   future.  We  are  the  backbone  of  Central  Continent’s  righteous  path,  how  can   we  bend  our  backs  in  front  of  Fang  Yuan?”</p>
<p>Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects’  Gu  Immortals  were  gathered   together,  listening  to  the  conversation  between  Star  Constellation  Immortal</p>
<p>Venerable  and  Qi  Sea’s  will.</p>
<p>Emotions  surged  in  their  hearts  and  many  even  cried.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  used  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  to  explain  this   situation  to  them  personally.</p>
<p>The  resentment,  confusion,  anger,  and  other  negative  feelings  hiding  in  their   hearts  were  swept  away.  Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects’  Gu   Immortals  were  now  filled  with  respect  towards  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  along  with  confidence  and  courage  to  protect  the   righteous  path.</p>
<p>But  at  the  next  moment,  a  Gu  Immortal  shouted:  ”Oh  no,  Heaven  Refining   Demon  Venerable  published  news  in  treasure  yellow  heaven  saying  that  we   captured  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  to  recreate  the  qi  harvest  fruit  and  revive   Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable!”</p>
<p>The  crowd  went  into  a  commotion  immediately.</p>
<p>Many  connected  to  treasure  yellow  heaven  and  some  of  them  started   cursing:  ”Fang  Yuan,  this  shameless,  despicable  scoundrel.  He  even   recorded  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  previous  nonchalance   towards  his  threat  in  a  video  and  is  playing  it  on  constant  loop  in  treasure   yellow  heaven.  He  is  trying  to  stir  the  hearts  of  Central  Continent’s  people   and  damage  our  Heavenly  Court’s  reputation!!”</p>
<p>“There  is  a  spy,  there  is  likely  Fang  Yuan’s  spy  hidden  among  us.   Otherwise,  why  will  he  suddenly  know  the  truth?!”  Someone  brought  up   the  possibility  of  a  spy,  making  the  Gu  Immortals  feel  even  more  at  unease.</p>
<p>Many  Gu  Immortals  openly  requested  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  to  inspect  everyone.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  shook  her  head  slightly:  ”Please   don’t  be  rash.  I  escorted  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  personally,  by  putting  such  an   emphasis  on  him,  it  had  already  created  doubts  in  Fang  Yuan’s  mind.”</p>
<p>“Venerables  are  not  easy  to  deceive,  it  is  normal  for  him  to  see  through  it.”</p>
<p>“Although  Fang  Yuan  cannot  bring  out  any  evidence  and  is  probably  not   certain  of  it  himself,  he  intentionally  let  out  this  information  to  gain  the   attention  of  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.”</p>
<p>“However,  it  doesn’t  matter.  I  will  be  staying  in  Heavenly  Court  and  won’t   go  out  for  the  following  time.  Even  if  Giant  Sun,  Fang  Yuan,  and  Spectral   Soul  get  into  an  alliance,  they  won’t  be  able  to  hinder  the  plan  of  reviving   Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable!”</p>
<p>“As  long  as  we  don’t  waver  and  stay  here,  Fang  Yuan  and  the  rest  won’t  be   able  to  do  anything.”</p>
<p>The  immortals’  gazes  shone  as  they  praised  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  unmatched  wisdom.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  indeed  an  expert  in  using  such   tricks.</p>
<p>Even  if  there  was  Fang  Yuan’s  spy  among  the  immortals,  she  did  not  intend   to  investigate  it.</p>
<p>What  was  the  point?</p>
<p>People  were  not  united  right  now,  with  Fang  Yuan  causing  a  great  massacre   in  Central  Continent,  it  would  stir  their  hearts  even  more.  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  could  not  even  unite  the  people’s  minds,  why  would   she  add  more  chaos  to  this?</p>
<p>Moreover,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  feel  fear  even  if   there  were  spies  here.  Even  if  Fang  Yuan,  Giant  Sun,  and  Spectral  Soul   attacked  together,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  the  confidence   to  defend  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>This  was  the  benefit  of  owning  their  own  headquarters!</p>
<p>No  matter  how  many  people  Fang  Yuan  killed,  or  how  miserable  Central   Continent’s  situation  became,  as  long  as  Star  Constellation  Immortal</p>
<p>Venerable  revived  Primordial  Origin,  it  would  be  a  huge  victory!</p>
<p>It  was  similar  to  the  earlier  situation  where  Fang  Yuan  was  beaten   miserably  by  Giant  Sun  and  Star  Constellation,  but  as  long  as  he  absorbed   the  dream  realms,  he  would  be  the  true  winner!</p>
<p>In  fact,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  already  preparing  to   revive  Primordial  Origin  even  back  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave.</p>
<p>When  she  was  seizing  the  Primordial  Domains,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  deliberately  searched  and  gathered  qi  path  and  wood  path   Primordial  Domains.</p>
<p>So,  once  Primordial  Domain  revived,  he  could  absorb  the  qi  path  Primordial   Domains.  Even  if  he  did  not  reach  supreme  grandmaster  attainment  level,   he  would  not  be  far  from  it.</p>
<p>What  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  worried  about  were   Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>Even  if  Primordial  Origin  revived,  if  he  did  not  have  Immortal  Gu  to  use,   he  could  not  use  his  full  strength.</p>
<p>This  was  the  situation  with  Star  Constellation  and  Giant  Sun,  they  did  not   have  suitable  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  and  had  completely  new  rank  nine   immortal  aperture;  their  condition  was  far  from  their  previous  life’s  peak   state.</p>
<p>“Heaven  qi  Immortal  Gu  and  earth  qi  Immortal  Gu  along  with  the  secluded   domain  of  heaven  and  earth  Hu  Land  are  with  Qi  Sea.  Adding  on  Heavenly   Court’s  human  qi  Immortal  Gu  and  other  Gu,  master’s  qi  path  Gu  worms   are  somewhat  gathered  now.”</p>
<p>“It  is  indeed  a  huge  pity  that  there  are  no  rank  nine  qi  path  Immortal  Gu,  but   maybe,  Primordial  Origin  Treasury  has  it?”</p>
<p>“When  master  revives,  he  can  activate  the  treasury,  I  won’t  need  to  search   for  clues  to  find  the  Primordial  Origin  Treasury.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  quietly  planned  internally.</p>
