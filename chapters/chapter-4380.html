        <p>:  Like  It  Was  Nothing!</p>
<p>The  battle  over  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  was  started  by  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>In  this  battle,  Fang  Yuan  revealed  new  killer  moves  like  Arrival  of  Dragon   Snake  with  Dust  Fog  and  Explosive  Soul  Wind,  Shocking  Departure  of   Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound,  and  heavenly  ghost  concealment.</p>
<p>Seven  kills  rainbow,  sword  tongue  dragon  soul,  and  other  killer  moves  were   greatly  improved,  and  there  were  also  obscured  heavenly  secret  and   heavenly  web  protection  veil  that  was  supporting  Fang  Yuan  secretly.</p>
<p>Thus,  Fang  Yuan  gained  the  upper  hand  in  the  battle,  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  no  choice  but  to   join  hands  to  match  him.</p>
<p>However,  because  Fang  Yuan  needed  to  protect  Meng  Qiu  Zhen,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  who  had  chaotic  intent  dispels  dream   killer  move  gradually  gained  the  initiative.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  Fang  Yuan’s  strength  made  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  wary.  No  matter  how  Fang  Yuan  tried  to  persuade  him,  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  was  firm  on  stopping  Fang  Yuan  from  obtaining  the   heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>As  a  result,  Fang  Yuan  ordered  his  subordinates  to  attack  Central   Continent’s  important  areas  to  harass  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  saw  through  Fang  Yuan’s  plan  and   did  not  return  to  defend  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>To  continue  hiding  his  strength  and  pretend  to  have  a  shortage  of  immortal   essence,  Fang  Yuan  angered  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  lured  him   into  battle.  He  used  heavenly  ghost  concealment  killer  move  to  become  half   an  alliance  mate  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  scheme  succeeded!</p>
<p>Because  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  disrupting  the  situation,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  were   not  able  to  emit  enough  pressure  on  Fang  Yuan.  But  conversely,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  continued  to  be  interrupted  by  Fang   Yuan  and  had  no  more  opportunities  to  harm  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.  Even  when   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  used  two  powerful  human  path  killer   moves,  it  was  hard  to  change  the  battle  situation.</p>
<p>The  battle  situation  was  in  a  stalemate,  and  as  time  passed,  heaven  path   dream  realms  annexed  each  other  and  were  mostly  absorbed  by  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  gains  in  this  battle  far  surpassed  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>On  the  contrary,  among  the  two  venerables;  one  lost  his  eldest  son  and  rank   nine  light  Gu  while  the  other’s  painstakingly  created  the  star  array   calculation  formation  was  almost  destroyed,  over  ten  Central  Continent  Gu   Immortals  were  killed  and  even  Heavenly  Court’s  Gu  Immortals  were  in  a   dangerous  situation.</p>
<p>This  made  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  come  to  a  complete   realization,  Fang  Yuan  had  won  a  huge  victory  in  this  battle.  No  matter  how   miserable  he  looked  now,  he  was  the  person  who  reaped  the  most  benefits!</p>
<p>“Whether  Fang  Yuan  still  has  trump  cards  or  not,  or  if  he  really  lacks   immortal  essence,  at  the  end  of  it,  the  crucial  factor  of  this  battle  was   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  looked  at  the  heavily  injured   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  she  was  reluctant,  furious,  and  also   helpless.</p>
<p>Since  long  ago,  she  had  wanted  to  get  rid  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  but  never  succeeded.</p>
<p>There  was  a  good  opportunity  before  but  Fang  Yuan  disturbed  them.  It  was   mainly  thanks  to  Fang  Yuan  that  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  could  still   stay  alive.</p>
<p>In  this  battle,  Fang  Yuan  used  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  to  obtain   huge  gains,  this  proved  how  far-sighted  he  was.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  injuries  were  mostly  received  in  place  of   Fang  Yuan.  He  had  less  than  one  thousand  arms  left,  his  enormous  body  had   shrunk  by  sixty  percent,  and  even  his  roar  sounded  hoarse  and  soft.</p>
<p>“Maybe,  this  is  a  chance  to  get  rid  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable!”  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  this  thought.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  a  huge  obstruction.</p>
<p>Although  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  controlled  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable  before,  she  was  much  clearer  than  others  that  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable  who  was  filled  with  heaven’s  will  could  not  longer   be  controlled  by  her.</p>
<p>Sometimes,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  admired  Fang  Yuan’s   craftiness  and  sinisterness.  He  was  able  to  successfully  turn  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable  into  half  an  alliance  mate.</p>
<p>Although  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  had  lost  his  senses,  under  Fang   Yuan’s  heavenly  ghost  concealment  killer  move,  he  was  even  more   dependable  than  ordinary  alliance  mates  and  was  also  easier  to  be  made  use   of.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  then  looked  at  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>Although  the  two  venerables  had  allied,  there  was  always  deep  vigilance   between  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  her.</p>
<p>Looking  back  at  this  battle,  even  though  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   used  his  full  strength,  it  was  of  little  effect  on  Fang  Yuan,  it  instead  cost   Central  Continent  a  lot.</p>
<p>The  comparison  showed  a  stark  contrast.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  would  rather  have  the  irrational   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  as  her  alliance  mate  than  be  allies  with  a   sane  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>But  if  she  wanted  to  get  rid  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  now,  she  still   had  to  get  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  help.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  immediately  transmitted  her  voice:   ”Giant  Sun,  there  is  no  need  to  care  about  Fang  Yuan  now.  Let’s  join  hands   to  get  rid  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable!  As  you  can  see  from  the   current  situation,  we  cannot  let  this  venerable  continue  living.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  deeply  agreed  with  these  words!</p>
<p>He  felt  that  they  were  not  able  to  deal  with  Fang  Yuan  mainly  because  of   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.  These  two’s  combination  truly  gave  him  a   headache.</p>
<p>Naturally,  Fang  Yuan  could  ’ally’  with  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable   because  of  heavenly  ghost  concealment  killer  move.  As  long  as  this  move   was  broken,  it  was  the  same  as  breaking  the  alliance  between  Fang  Yuan   and  Spectral  Soul.</p>
<p>But  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  also  aware  that  even  if  he  broke  it   this  time,  Fang  Yuan  could  continue  to  modify  it.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  a  refinement  path  venerable,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   did  not  think  highly  of  his  modification  abilities  before.  But  after  this  battle,   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  who  was  baptized  by  killer  moves  like   Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound  and  Arrival   of  Dragon  Snake  with  Dust  Fog  and  Explosive  Soul  Wind  changed  his   perception  fully.</p>
<p>Right  now,  in  his  opinion,  Fang  Yuan’s  wisdom  path  attainment  was  already   above  him.  Even  when  looking  at  all  the  venerables,  besides  Limitless   Demon  Venerable,  Fang  Yuan  was  right  below  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable!</p>
<p>So,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  want  to  play  the  pointless  game   of  unraveling,  modifying,  then  unraveling  again  before  modifying  again   with  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>“It  is  a  good  idea  indeed  to  kill  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable!  We  can   end  this  problem  once  and  for  all,  Fang  Yuan  will  have  no  alliance  mate   left.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  transmitted  his  reply  to  Star   Constellation.</p>
<p>“Moreover,  Fang  Yuan  lacks  immortal  essence  right  now,  but  we  are   different.  It  will  be  much  more  difficult  for  him  to  protect  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable  now.  If  he  exhausts  all  his  strength  to  protect  the  latter,  he   may  land  in  a  predicament  with  just  a  slight  carelessness.  At  that  time,  we   can  then  target  him  and  even  create  an  opportunity  to  behead  this  Heaven   Refining  Demon  Venerable!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  not  as  optimistic  as  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable,  she  replied:  ”Fang  Yuan  will  never  throw  himself  in  a   predicament  to  protect  Spectral  Soul.”</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  reached  a  consensus  and  focused  all  their  attacks  on   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>“They  made  this  decision  indeed.”  Fang  Yuan  revealed  a  troubled   expression  but  was  getting  increasingly  excited  inwardly.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  fought  fiercely  with  the  two  venerables,   and  with  Fang  Yuan’s  help  from  the  side,  both  sides  would  suffer.</p>
<p>But  in  the  end,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  would  probably  die.</p>
<p>After  all,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  filled  with  heaven’s  will.  He   did  not  have  any  sanity  and  used  immortal  killer  moves  randomly,  it  was   really  too  much  of  a  disadvantage.</p>
<p>But  like  this,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  would  also  be  weakened  greatly.</p>
<p>This  was  a  great  opportunity  to  get  rid  of  two  venerables!</p>
<p>As  long  as  they  did  not  escape  to  their  headquarters,  Fang  Yuan  had   certainty  to  kill  one  of  them  with  his  full  strength.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  kill  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  but  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  thinking  of  a  chance  to   get  rid  of  Fang  Yuan  while  Fang  Yuan  was  also  plotting  to  get  rid  of  the   two.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  attacked  by  the  full  strength  of  the  two   venerables,  his  injuries  continued  to  become  more  severe.  Many  of  his  large   black  arms  were  broken,  leaving  behind  only  two-three  hundred.</p>
<p>“Go!”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  suddenly  threw  a  golden  meteor.</p>
<p>The  meteor  struck  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  destroyed  one  of  his   heads.</p>
<p>Out  of  his  three  heads,  only  one  remained  now.  He  was  forced  into  a   desperate  situation  with  danger  everywhere  around  him  but  Fang  Yuan  still   attacked  steadily,  deliberately  maintaining  the  frequency  of  his  attacks.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  roared  furiously,  a  large  blue  fire  burned  on   his  body.</p>
<p>But  this  fire  was  not  burning  hot,  instead,  it  let  out  a  strong  chill.</p>
<p>The  temperature  dropped  rapidly.</p>
<p>Rank  nine  fire  Gu  finally  could  not  sit  still,  it  felt  the  danger  to  its  host’s  life   and  finally  used  its  strength!</p>
<p>It  was  rank  nine  after  all,  all  three  venerables  retreated,  even  Fang  Yuan   who  had  heavenly  ghost  concealment  was  the  same.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  relied  on  this  killer  move  to  deceive  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  but  he  could  not  deceive  rank  nine  fire  Gu.  After  all,  it  was  a  Gu   worm  and  not  a  soul  beast.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  remained  still.  The  blue  fire  quickly   spread,  forcing  the  three  venerables  to  continue  retreating.</p>
<p>The  fire  expanded  towards  the  heaven  path  dream  realms.  The  dream   realms  shrunk  rapidly  and  were  actually  being  burned!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  eyes  shone  with  a  sharp  light  as  he  thought:  “<<The  Legends   of  Ren  Zu>>  stated  that  dream  realms  are  restrained  by  fire  Gu,  looks  like  it   is  true.”</p>
<p>He  felt  that  it  was  a  pity.</p>
<p>While  fighting  with  the  venerables,  his  heaven  path  attainment  level  had   already  advanced  from  grandmaster  to  great  grandmaster  level.</p>
<p>Moreover,  he  had  not  just  stepped  into  great  grandmaster,  his  accumulation   was  already  deep  and  robust.</p>
<p>If  Fang  Yuan  absorbed  all  of  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  here,  he  might   even  be  able  to  advance  to  supreme  grandmaster  level.  Even  if  he  could  not,   he  had  a  high  possibility  of  becoming  a  quasi-supreme  grandmaster.</p>
<p>However,  most  of  the  remaining  heaven  path  dream  realms  were  destroyed   by  fire  Gu.</p>
<p>“This  is  an  opportunity,  Giant  Sun!”  Looking  at  this  scene,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  started  preparing  chaotic  intent  dispels   dream  killer  move.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  protect  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable,  instead,  charging  towards  the  heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  immediately  fell  into  a  dilemma  of  advancing  or  retreating!</p>
<p>Within  the  spark  of  a  moment,  he  made  a  decision,  he  gave  up  on  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  pounced  upon  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  blocked  by  Fang  Yuan,  the  two   venerables  fought  fiercely.</p>
<p>In  this  process,  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  were  burned  by  the  fire,  there   was  almost  none  left.  Be  it  Fairy  Zi  Wei,  Ying  Wu  Xie  or  Meng  Qiu  Zhen,   they  were  all  burning!</p>
<p>While  Fang  Yuan  obstructed  Giant  Sun,  he  was  also  getting  closer  to  the   heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>Seeing  this,  he  immediately  gave  up  on  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and   went  in  the  direction  of  his  dream  path  clone.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  eyes  were  closed  and  would  not  wake  up  in  a  short  while.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  saw  Fang  Yuan  ignoring  him  and  leaving,  he   shouted  in  fury:  ”Fang  Yuan,  such  audacity!  I  will  make  you  pay.”</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  hundreds  of  golden  meteors  shot  out  together.  Their   power  was  so  terrifying  that  even  heaven  and  earth  changed  colors.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  finally  finished   preparing  her  killer  move  and  activated  chaotic  intent  dispels  dream.</p>
<p>She  directly  attacked  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>Bam  bam  bam  bam!</p>
<p>The  golden  meteors  struck  Fang  Yuan  and  Meng  Qiu  Zhen,  explosions  rang   continuously,  shaking  the  world.</p>
<p>Terrifying  air  waves  rampaged  in  every  direction.</p>
<p>The  golden  lights  dissipated,  Fang  Yuan  and  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  were  moving   down  extremely  quickly.</p>
<p>“Huh?!”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  eyes  almost  popped  out,  Fang   Yuan  was  not  even  injured  at  all.</p>
<p>What  kind  of  defensive  killer  move  was  this!</p>
<p>“Oh  no!”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  expression  changed   greatly.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  headed  towards  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>As  for  Meng  Qiu  Zhen,  he  was  already  awake  and  had  activated  dream   armor  Gu  to  protect  himself.  At  the  same  time,  his  body  was  covered  by  a   layer  of  rippling  reverse  flow  protection  seal.</p>
<p>Through  Fang  Yuan’s  modification,  reverse  flow  protection  seal  could  help   others  as  well  and  was  not  limited  to  himself.</p>
<p>With  two  layers  of  defense,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen,  just  like  the  main  body,  took   on  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  killer  move  like  it  was  nothing.</p>
