        <p>:  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  Crisis</p>
<p>Although  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  participated  in  the  battle,  he  had   been  preserving  his  strength.</p>
<p>He  wanted  to  save  his  immortal  essence  and  continue  to  hide  his  trump   cards  while  making  Star  Constellation  and  Fang  Yuan  expend  each  other’s   immortal  essence.</p>
<p>Although  Fang  Yuan’s  situation  was  bad  and  was  in  a  disadvantage,  he  was   actually  making  gains  constantly.  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  could  not   take  it  anymore.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  was  an  Immortal  Venerable,  he  would  not  be  easily  deceived  by   the  advantage  they  had  right  now.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan,  take  this  move!”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  shouted  as  he   used  two  killer  moves,  lingering  scrap  luck  and  accumulated  return,  in   succession.</p>
<p>Lingering  scrap  luck’s  activation  was  extremely  fast,  Fang  Yuan  could  not   dodge  it.</p>
<p>It  was  because  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  used  this  move  towards   himself  and  not  on  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Faint  golden  fog  curled  up  around  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>But  the  next  moment,  this  golden  fog  appeared  indescribably  on  Fang   Yuan’s  body!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  startled  for  a  moment  before  understand  the  profundity  in   this  move.</p>
<p>When  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  fought  with  Fang  Yuan,  their  luck   continued  to  entangle  and  form  a  close  connection  like  a  bridge.  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  acted  based  on  this  and  easily  sent  lingering  scrap  luck   to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  also  had  high  luck  path  attainment  and  immediately  saw  through   this.</p>
<p>But  his  luck  path  attainment  was  far  inferior  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable’s,  even  if  he  saw  through  this  profundity,  it  was  hard  for  him  to   stop  it.</p>
<p>Lingering  scrap  luck  killer  move  coiled  around  Fang  Yuan’s  body,   constantly  scrapping  his  luck.</p>
<p>Reverse  flow  protection  seal  was  triggered  at  this  moment  and  reflected   lingering  scrap  luck  killer  move.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  happy  to  see  this,  he  coordinated  with   reverse  flow  protection  seal  and  let  this  backlash  reach  him  by  following   their  connected  luck.</p>
<p>Accumulated  return  killer  move  showed  its  effect,  increasingly  the  density   of  his  surrounding  golden  fog.</p>
<p>The  slightly  denser  golden  fog  followed  the  connection  of  the  luck  and   returned  to  Fang  Yuan’s  body.</p>
<p>Lingering  scrap  luck  killer  move  was  reflected  once  again  by  reverse  flow   protection  seal,  and  was  again  strengthened  by  Giant  Sun  Immortal</p>
<p>Venerable’s  accumulated  return  before  it  returned  to  Fang  Yuan’s  body   again.</p>
<p>As  this  back  and  forth  action  continued,  lingering  scrap  luck’s  power   continued  to  grow.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  a  solemn  expression,  venerables  could  not  be   underestimated.  It  was  not  only  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  who   thought  of  a  counter  to  reverse  flow  protection  seal,  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  also  did  the  same.</p>
<p>Comparatively,  as  a  wisdom  path  Gu  Immortal,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  method  was  even  more  thorough  as  it  directly  bypassed  reverse   flow  protection  seal.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  method  was  not  thorough,  he  chose  a   different  approach  which  was  to  imitate  reverse  flow  protection  seal.   Reverse  flow  protection  seal  could  reflect  attacks,  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  also  reflected  them  back.</p>
<p>With  the  two  linked  moves,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  gained  an   advantage.</p>
<p>Simply  because  lingering  scrap  luck  killer  move  was  becoming  increasingly   strong,  even  if  reverse  flow  protection  seal  could  reflect  it,  Reverse  Flow   River  had  a  fixed  amount  of  water.</p>
<p>While  both  sides  had  not  reached  the  limit,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   achieved  his  goal  of  using  his  immortal  essence  to  expend  Reverse  Flow   River.</p>
<p>Reverse  flow  protection  seal  was  very  hard  to  deal  with  indeed.  In  the  past   fights  with  Fang  Yuan,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  used  all  kinds  of   attacks  to  trigger  reverse  flow  protection  seal  and  expend  Reverse  Flow   River.</p>
<p>Now,  he  was  using  lingering  scrap  luck  and  accumulated  return  together,  it   was  much  more  efficient  than  directly  attacking.</p>
<p>Using  immortal  essence  to  expend  a  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth   was  also  a  huge  gain.</p>
<p>After  all,  it  was  much  easier  to  accumulate  immortal  essence  than  to  restore   Reverse  Flow  River.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  shocked  and  furious:  ”Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  I  will   definitely  pay  you  back  for  this.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  looked  at  Fang  Yuan  and  sighed  inwardly.   He  felt  that  it  was  unwise  of  Fang  Yuan  to  fight  for  the  heaven  path  dream   realms!</p>
<p>However,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  thought  about  it  and  understood   the  reason  behind  his  decision.</p>
<p>‘After  all,  heaven  path  dream  realms  are  resources  that  can  overturn  the   contest  of  the  venerables!’</p>
<p>‘If  these  heaven  path  dream  realms  are  changed  to  a  rank  nine  blood  path   Immortal  Gu,  blood  path  or  even  luck  path  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and   earth,  I  will  be  blinded  by  greed  too.’</p>
<p>‘Looks  like  Fang  Yuan  plans  to  develop  heaven  path.’</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  used  his  hidden  methods  to  further  suppress   Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>On  the  other  side,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  finished  preparing   her  killer  move.  Boundless  azure  radiance  spread  as  she  activated  the  move.</p>
<p>The  radiance  shone  on  the  dream  realms,  the  heaven  path  dream  realms   went  berserk;  their  shape  distorted  constantly  like  a  spasm,  turning  into   dough  that  was  kneaded  constantly.</p>
<p>‘Oh  no!  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  actually  has  a  method  to   target  the  dream  realms.’  A  sharp  light  flashed  across  Fang  Yuan’s  eyes.</p>
<p>He  immediately  canceled  reverse  flow  protection  seal,  only  using  obscured   heavenly  secret  and  heavenly  web  protection  veil  to  forcibly  endure  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  attack  while  rushing  towards  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>After  Fang  Yuan’s  clone,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen,  entered  the  heaven  path  dream   realm,  his  vision  changed.</p>
<p>Shortly  after,  he  found  that  he  had  turned  into  a  land  spirit  in  the  shape  of  a   pink  cloth  doll.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  was  not  surprised.</p>
<p>He  snickered  and  began  to  use  his  power  to  change  and  manage  this  blessed   land  in  the  dream.</p>
<p>Different  from  Fairy  Zi  Wei  and  Ying  Wu  Xie,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  came  fully   prepared.</p>
<p>Since  Fang  Yuan  took  the  initiative  to  make  a  move,  he  naturally  made   sufficient  preparation.  Although  he  could  not  fully  understand  the   complexities  of  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  with  stealing  heavenly  secret,   he  had  a  clear  idea  of  the  general  rules  in  the  dream  realms.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  tested  for  a  while  and  learned  the  limit  of  his  capabilities.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Butterfly  Explores  Heavenly  Secret!</p>
<p>This  move  used  dream  path  investigative  Immortal  Gu  Dream  Butterfly  as   the  core,  it  was  based  on  exposing  heavenly  secret  killer  move,  and  was</p>
<p>specifically  made  to  be  used  in  heaven  path  dream  realms.  It  could  obtain   the  details  of  the  calamities  and  tribulations  in  heaven  path  dream  realms  in   advance.</p>
<p>This  move  was  one  of  the  preparations  Fang  Yuan  made.</p>
<p>After  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  used  this  move,  he  knew  the  details  of  the  first   earthly  calamity.  But  he  was  not  satisfied  as  he  used  the  move  another  two   times,  expending  a  lot  of  immortal  essence  to  probe  the  types  and  scale  of   the  next  two  earthly  calamities.</p>
<p>This  was  different  from  exposing  heavenly  secret.</p>
<p>Exposing  heavenly  secret  could  only  explore  the  details  of  the  next  calamity   and  tribulation;  moreover,  the  Gu  cultivator  could  not  be  too  far  away  from   the  next  tribulation.</p>
<p>But  butterfly  explores  heavenly  secret  could  probe  the  details  of  the  next   three  calamities.  Naturally,  this  number  was  related  to  the  power  of  the   killer  move  as  well  as  the  size  of  the  heaven  path  dream  realm.</p>
<p>After  finishing  all  this,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  began  to  manage  the  blessed  land.</p>
<p>There  was  only  a  rock  field  before  him,  flat  and  lifeless.</p>
<p>He  assembled  wind  and  cloud  to  accumulate  lightning  and  bombarded  the   rock  field.</p>
<p>Thirty  percent  of  the  rock  field  was  blasted  away,  the  remaining  portion  was   filled  with  cracks  and  ravines.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  stopped  the  lightning  and  began  to  control  the  strength  of   the  land.</p>
<p>The  rock  field  that  had  lost  thirty  percent  of  its  area  was  no  longer  as   compact  as  before,  after  resisting  for  a  while,  it  finally  began  to  tremor   slightly.</p>
<p>The  tremors  continued  to  grow  bigger  until  deep  trenches  formed.</p>
<p>After  the  earth  trenches  formed,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  moved  wind  and  clouds   again,  accumulating  heavy  clouds.  But  this  time,  he  did  not  create  lightning   but  heavy  rain.</p>
<p>There  were  very  few  water  path  dao  marks  in  this  heaven  path  dream   realm’s  blessed  land  which  was  not  favorable  to  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  plan.</p>
<p>But  under  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  continuous  effort,  rainwater  accumulated,   finally  overflowing  out  of  the  earth  trenches  and  covering  the  rock  field.</p>
<p>After  finishing  all  these,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  calculated  the  time  and  noticed   that  he  had  already  spent  a  lot  of  time,  it  was  nearing  the  first  earthly   calamity.</p>
<p>He  activated  create  dream  killer  move  to  create  countless  firm  rock  spikes   out  of  nothing.</p>
<p>When  he  almost  changed  the  whole  rock  field  into  a  land  of  spikes,  the  first   earthly  calamity  arrived.</p>
<p>It  was  a  desolate  beast  calamity.</p>
<p>A  ferocious  four-armed  ape  intruded  the  blessed  land.</p>
<p>It  roared  as  it  fixed  its  gaze  at  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  and  ran  towards  him.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  was  a  land  spirit  but  had  no  ability  to  teleport,  so  he  was   chased  by  the  four-armed  ape  everywhere.</p>
<p>Looking  at  the  four-armed  ape  not  giving  up  on  him  and  destroying   countless  earth  spikes  wherever  it  passed  by,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  did  not  panic,   instead,  he  smiled  slightly.</p>
<p>Everything  was  within  his  plan.</p>
<p>The  four-armed  ape  rampaged  for  a  while  before  its  whole  body  became   covered  in  injuries  and  blood.</p>
<p>This  stimulated  its  bestial  nature,  it  became  increasingly  berserk  and  its   speed  finally  surpassed  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  was  already  prepared,  he  stopped  running  on  the  ground   and  drilled  into  the  earth  trenches.</p>
<p>His  size  was  small,  and  although  the  four-armed  ape  was  agile,  it  was  as   large  as  an  elephant.  It  was  stopped  outside,  it  stretched  its  long  arm  into  the   earth  trench  but  could  not  grab  onto  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  even  easily  experienced  the  power  of  a  land  spirit.</p>
<p>In  fact,  this  was  an  extremely  rare  and  valuable  experience!</p>
<p>Gu  Immortals  were  not  land  spirits,  they  might  be  the  owner  of  their   immortal  aperture  but  their  control  over  their  own  immortal  aperture  was   far  lower  than  land  spirits  or  heavenly  spirits.</p>
<p>It  was  like  how  Fang  Yuan  had  to  spread  his  divine  sense  to  the  whole  of   sovereign  immortal  aperture  to  inspect  the  situation.</p>
<p>Land  spirits  or  heavenly  spirits  were  formed  by  Gu  Immortal  obsessions   fused  with  the  immortal  aperture’s  heavenly  power.</p>
<p>In  this  sense,  land  spirits  and  heavenly  spirits  were  one  with  the  immortal   aperture.  The  Gu  Immortal’s  obsession  gave  them  their  spirituality.</p>
<p>Land  spirits  and  heavenly  spirits  had  an  extremely  deep  understanding  and   control  over  the  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  to  use  perceivable  dao  Immortal  Gu  or  such  methods  to   inspect  the  number  of  his  dao  marks.  But  land  spirits  or  heavenly  spirits   could  easily  know  it;  they  only  had  to  concentrate  slightly  and  they  would   know  the  number  and  distribution  of  the  dao  marks.</p>
<p>This  chasing  and  escaping  situation  continued  for  several  days,  Meng  Qiu   Zhen  had  no  injuries,  but  the  four-armed  ape  was  heavily  injured  and  died   after  exhausting  all  its  strength.</p>
<p>After  it  died,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  used  wind  and  rain  to  decompose  its  blood   and  flesh,  before  using  lightning  to  turn  its  bones  into  scraps.  He  then   buried  the  bones  underground,  all  the  strength  path  dao  marks  were  quickly   added  to  the  blessed  land.</p>
<p>After  finishing  all  these,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  opened  his  small  doll  palm  and   crushed  a  small  rock.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  nodded  with  joy.</p>
<p>The  land  spirit’s  strength  was  connected  to  the  heavenly  power  of  the  small   world.  What  was  the  foundation  of  the  heavenly  power?</p>
<p>It  was  the  dao  marks  in  the  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>After  passing  the  four-armed  ape  desolate  beast  earthly  calamity,  the   blessed  land’s  strength  path  dao  marks  surged  which  increased  Meng  Qiu   Zhen’s  strength.  He  could  crush  these  firm  rocks  which  he  had  not  been   able  to  do  earlier.</p>
<p>Crushing  the  rock  pieces  was  only  a  small  display,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  gathered   his  strength  and  stirred  the  water  surface,  creating  huge  waves.</p>
