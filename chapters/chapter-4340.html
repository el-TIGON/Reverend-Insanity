        <p>:  Born  with  a  Rank  Five  Gu</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  divine  sense  spread  rapidly  in  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>“Maybe  I  should  build  some  small  wisdom  path  formations  so  my  divine   sense  can  spread  here  more  easily?”  Fang  Yuan  thought.</p>
<p>His  divine  sense  was  moving  at  a  rapid  speed  but  the  sovereign  immortal   aperture  was  just  too  big.  It  was  too  troublesome  for  Fang  Yuan  to  look  into   his  immortal  aperture  closely  each  time  he  entered.</p>
<p>Ordinary  Gu  Immortals  had  no  such  issue.  Although  their  immortal  aperture   was  called  a  small  world,  it  could  not  compare  to  Fang  Yuan’s  sovereign   immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Not  long  after,  Fang  Yuan’s  divine  sense  reached  the  destination.</p>
<p>Mini  Western  Desert,  Inkman  City.</p>
<p>There  was  a  family  at  an  unassuming  corner  of  the  city.</p>
<p>The  man  of  the  family  was  a  young  inkman  Gu  Master,  he  had  limited   aptitude  and  only  had  rank  two  cultivation.  Currently,  he  had  a  nervous   expression  as  he  paced  outside  the  room.</p>
<p>Waaaa—!</p>
<p>The  crying  of  a  baby  could  be  heard  coming  from  within  the  room.</p>
<p>The  man  immediately  showed  an  expression  of  joy.</p>
<p>He  rushed  into  the  room  and  saw  his  wife  and  the  female  doctor  who  he  had   hired  at  a  high  price.</p>
<p>The  female  doctor  was  hiding  a  male  inkman  baby.</p>
<p>He  was  very  small  and  ugly  but  was  healthy.</p>
<p>“Everything  is  normal,  except…”  The  female  doctor  smiled  at  the  man  and   directed  her  gaze  to  the  baby’s  arm.</p>
<p>In  his  hands,  there  were  a  pair  of  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>They  were  bone  flesh  unity  Gu!</p>
<p>The  female  doctor  had  an  expression  of  shock,  because  she  was  the  doctor   here,  she  saw  that  this  pair  of  Gu  worms  were  born  alongside  the  baby.</p>
<p>“If  I  had  not  been  here  the  entire  time,  I  would  not  have  believed  this.  Is   this…  the  effect  of  the  Pregnancy  Temple?”  The  female  doctor  asked  the   male  inkman.</p>
<p>The  male  inkman  saw  this  immediately.</p>
<p>His  eyes  turned  red  after  seeing  the  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>With  his  strength  and  wealth,  he  would  need  to  expend  a  vast  amount  of   time  and  effort  to  get  such  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>But  now,  this  pair  of  rare  Gu  worms  was  born  alongside  his  son!</p>
<p>This  was  such  a  huge  surprise.</p>
<p>The  male  inkman  nodded,  he  said  chokingly:  ”Yes,  after  the  Pregnancy   Temple  was  built,  my  wife  and  I  went  to  give  it  a  try.  To  think  that  it  really   worked!”</p>
<p>The  female  doctor  sighed  and  said:  ”You  must  not  be  the  only  one.  This   Pregnancy  Temple  really  works  as  they  said,  it  can  help  you  to  rapidly  have   children,  and  if  lucky,  they  will  be  born  with  Gu  worms.”</p>
<p>The  male  inkman  wanted  to  speak  but  hesitated.</p>
<p>The  female  doctor  casted  him  a  gaze  of  suspicion.</p>
<p>On  the  bed,  the  weak  female  inkman  spoke  now,  she  wanted  the  doctor  to   test  their  bloodline.</p>
<p>The  female  doctor  was  stunned,  she  realized  that  they  were  worried  this   baby  was  not  their  own.</p>
<p>Immediately  after,  the  test  was  completed.</p>
<p>It  was  a  joyful  ending.</p>
<p>“This  is  my  son,  I  finally  have  a  son.  Oh  goodness,  I  finally  have  a  son!”   The  male  inkman  had  no  hesitation  anymore,  he  held  the  baby  and  cried   tears  of  joy.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  divine  sense  observed  the  scene  and  left  quietly.</p>
<p>This  Pregnancy  Temple  was  his  arrangement.</p>
<p>There  were  many  of  such  mortal  Gu  Houses,  after  Fang  Yuan  built  them,  he   placed  them  all  over  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture  for  the  people  to  use.</p>
<p>Pregnancy  Temple  was  a  human  path  Immortal  Gu  House,  the  core  human   path  Gu  worms  it  used  included:  become  pregnant  Gu,  triplet  Gu,  dead   fetus  Gu,  multiple  pregnancy  Gu,  and  safe  pregnancy  Gu.</p>
<p>It  even  used  a  large  number  of  time  path  and  refinement  path  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>The  actual  effect  of  Pregnancy  Temple  was  to  extract  the  yin-yang  qi  of  the   male  and  female  to  activate  become  pregnant  Gu  and  make  the  female   pregnant.</p>
<p>After  that,  it  would  use  triplet  Gu  to  turn  the  fetus  into  triplets.</p>
<p>After  that,  two  of  the  fetuses  would  be  used  as  Gu  materials  after  dead  fetus   Gu  activated,  while  the  final  one  would  be  protected  by  safe  pregnancy  Gu.</p>
<p>The  two  dead  fetuses  would  be  refined  as  bone  flesh  unity  Gu,  born   together  with  the  final  fetus.</p>
<p>The  entire  process  of  the  pregnancy  to  childbirth  would  not  take  more  than   seven  days,  this  was  the  effect  of  time  path  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>In  that  case,  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  population  would  rise   rapidly.  Once  the  population  went  up,  more  clans  would  be  created,  and   under  the  effect  of  the  ’dream  path  method’,  their  aptitudes  would  rise   together  and  produce  more  Gu  Immortal  seeds.</p>
<p>Throughout  the  process,  the  citizens  of  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture   would  feel  more  admiration  and  love  towards  their  great  leader  Fang  Yuan,   they  would  feel  indebted  to  him!</p>
<p>It  was  clear  that  they  would  become  increasingly  loyal  to  him.</p>
<p>“The  bone  flesh  unity  Gu  that  comes  with  the  baby  act  as  the  vital  Gu  and  is   refined  naturally.  Once  these  babies  are  born,  they  will  have  a  rank  five   vital  Gu.  After  bone  flesh  unity  Gu  reaches  a  certain  level,  they  will  switch   to  other  Gu  worms.  In  that  case,  the  growth  of  these  babies  will  be   accelerated!”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  planned  inwardly.</p>
<p>It  was  not  hard  for  the  current  him  to  achieve  this,  it  was  completely  a   breeze.</p>
<p>He  used  the  human  body  Gu  refinement  method,  which  was  one  of  the  peak   profundities  of  refinement  path,  originating  from  Ni  clan.</p>
<p>When  Ni  clan’s  bloodline  reach  a  certain  density,  the  current  generation  Ni   Xiang  would  be  born  with  an  Immortal  Gu  appearing  in  their  body.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  only  producing  mortal  Gu  now.</p>
<p>“When  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  created  yin-yang  path,  the  essence   was  in  Gu  worms  like  abortion  Gu,  safe  pregnancy  Gu,  and  multiple   pregnancy  Gu.  All  the  past  venerables  have  comprehended  some  human   path  killer  moves  from  <<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>,  but  these  methods  are   too  profound  and  not  suited  for  the  masses.  Thus,  Heavenly  Court  arranged   for  Divine  Emperor  City  to  develop  the  foundation  of  human  path.”</p>
<p>“The  truth  is,  there  is  a  very  special  man  among  the  venerables,  he  had   actually  created  many  foundational  mortal  Gu  of  human  path,  but  had   always  kept  them  to  himself  and  did  not  popularize  them.”</p>
<p>“The  prospect  and  development  of  human  path  is  truly  great.”  Fang  Yuan   sighed.</p>
<p>Higher  level  human  path  killer  moves  were  able  to  easily  turn  the  situation   of  the  fate  war  around,  while  lower  level  methods  had  incredible  use.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  certain  that  human  path  was  not  inferior  to  heaven  path!</p>
<p>Most  importantly,  human  path  had  not  developed  yet.</p>
<p>“Human  path  is  suppressed  by  the  Heavenly  Dao.  Just  these  human  path   mortal  Gu  that  are  created  by  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  have  such  a   terrifying  effect.  How  can  the  Heavenly  Dao  that  emphasizes  balance  allow   such  a  qualitative  change  in  the  growth  of  humanity?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  increasingly  understanding  why  Heavenly  Court  was   focusing  on  developing  human  path.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  always  been  tampering  with  heaven’s  will  using  fate   Gu  as  their  pillar.</p>
<p>After  fate  Gu  was  destroyed,  Heavenly  Court  became  the  number  one  super   force  that  heaven’s  will  disliked.</p>
<p>Being  unable  to  use  heaven’s  will,  Heavenly  Court  decided  to  develop   human  path  instead.</p>
<p>“But  why  would  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  not  know  about  the   weakness  of  the  derivation  formation?”  Fang  Yuan  had  a  deep  and  eerie   gaze.</p>
<p>Derivation  formation  was  situated  in  Heavenly  Court,  any  research  results   that  it  produced  would  be  known  by  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>This  meant  that  as  those  Gu  cultivators  who  entered  the  derivation   formation  grew,  the  Heavenly  Dao  also  grew  together  with  them!</p>
<p>But  even  if  the  Heavenly  Dao  gained  from  this,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  still  had  benefits  to  gain  from  using  the  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>She  could  develop  herself  to  surpass  the  other  venerables.</p>
<p>It  was  possible  that  in  her  plan,  she  would  first  eliminate  the  other   venerables  and  make  Heavenly  Court  the  dominating  force  before  dealing   with  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>“Thus,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  has  not  entered  the  derivation   formation  herself,  or  is  she  waiting  for  a  chance?”  Fang  Yuan  guessed  to   himself.</p>
<p>At  least,  Fang  Yuan  knew  that  Crazed  Demon  Cave  was  the  most  suitable   place  to  put  the  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>The  first  seven  layers  of  Crazed  Demon  Cave  could  not  isolate  heaven’s   will,  but  the  eighth  and  ninth  layers  were  safe.</p>
<p>Other  than  that,  Fang  Yuan  could  not  see  any  other  possibilities.</p>
<p>It  would  not  work  if  one  placed  the  derivation  formation  into  a  venerable   aperture.</p>
<p>Because  the  wild  derivation  Gu  was  rank  nine,  it  contained  too  much   heaven’s  will.  If  placed  into  the  venerable’s  immortal  aperture,  the  heaven’s   will  within  would  connect  with  the  heaven’s  will  of  the  five  regions,   allowing  the  venerable  to  be  detected  by  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  once  suffered  a  loss  from  this.</p>
<p>“Limitless  Demon  Venerable  created  the  Crazed  Demon  formation,  but  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  must  have  been  a  part  of  it.  After  all,  the   formation  needs  wisdom  path’s  help.  This  is  also  why  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  held  the  initiative  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  after   returning  to  Heavenly  Court,  she  easily  created  the  derivation  formation.   But  Crazed  Demon  Cave  itself  must  have  been  made  by  Limitless  Demon   Venerable  alone.  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  does  not  know  of   its  profundity,  otherwise,  it  will  be  the  first  thing  she  constructs.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  divine  sense  continued  to  search.</p>
<p>There  were  many  families  in  Inkman  City  that  had  given  birth  to  children.</p>
<p>The  situation  was  quite  successful,  each  newborn  had  a  bone  flesh  unity  Gu   as  their  vital  Gu.</p>
<p>Come  to  speak  of  it,  bone  flesh  unity  Gu’s  recipe  was  modified  by  Fang   Yuan.</p>
<p>Rank  eight  wisdom  Gu  was  of  some  help  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>During  this  period  of  time,  he  easily  raised  wisdom  Gu  to  rank  eight.</p>
<p>In  addition,  Refinement  Sea  and  Human  Sea  were  completed.</p>
<p>It  was  just  that  Human  Sea  lacked  Human  Mountain,  it  was  not  a  complete   secluded  domain  now  and  could  still  be  expended.</p>
<p>The  cost  of  reviving  mortals  was  much  cheaper  than  Gu  Immortals,  it  could   last  for  a  very  long  time.</p>
<p>Other  than  Human  Sea  and  Refinement  Sea,  Fang  Yuan  had  also  collected   many  fragments  of  the  Qian  Kun  Crystal  Wall.</p>
<p>Most  of  the  Qian  Kun  Crystal  Wall  fragments  scattered  in  Eastern  Sea,   Southern  Border,  and  Western  Desert  were  currently  in  Fang  Yuan’s  hands.</p>
<p>As  for  the  other  two  regions,  because  of  the  existence  of  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  Fang  Yuan   did  not  ask  about  them  when  he  used  stealing  heavenly  secret.</p>
<p>The  complete  Qian  Kun  Crystal  Wall  was  even  stronger  than  stealing   heavenly  secret,  it  contained  the  information  of  all  situations  that  happened   in  the  world.</p>
<p>If  stealing  heavenly  secret  was  said  to  be  a  ladle  that  was  drawing  water   from  the  vat,  then  the  Qian  Kun  Crystal  Wall  was  the  vat  itself!</p>
<p>According  to  Fang  Yuan’s  understanding  after  using  stealing  heavenly   secret,  the  complete  Qian  Kun  Crystal  Wall  could  create  Primordial   Domain!!</p>
<p>Moving  his  divine  sense,  Fang  Yuan  left  Inkman  City  and  came  to  Mini   Eastern  Sea  to  inspect  the  Floating  Refinement  Hives.</p>
<p>These  Floating  Refinement  Hives  were  arranged  appropriately,  there  were   no  issues.</p>
<p>They  were  originally  derived  from  the  Fang  Yuan  stone  nest.</p>
<p>Back  then,  Fang  Yuan  had  the  concept  of  a  production  line,  he  created  these   stone  nests  and  arranged  for  many  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  to  refine  Gu.</p>
<p>Right  now,  each  of  the  Floating  Refinement  Hives  were  an  incomplete   secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth,  they  were  far  superior  to  the  Fang   Yuan  stone  nest  back  then.</p>
<p>There  were  already  many  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  in  some  of  the  Floating   Refinement  Hives.</p>
<p>The  first  batch  of  Gu  worms  to  refine  were  relic  Gu  and  connecting  heaven   Gu.</p>
<p>After  Fang  Yuan’s  divine  sense  looked  around  for  a  while,  he  left  again.</p>
<p>After  a  while,  under  the  control  of  his  divine  sense,  countless  Gu  worms   expended  his  rich  reserves  of  rank  nine  immortal  essence  to  activate  an   immortal  killer  move  —  Endless  Trouble.</p>
<p>The  core  Immortal  Gu  of  this  move  was  rank  eight  After,  it  could  delay  the   current  calamity  or  tribulation  to  the  next  time,  and  face  them  together.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  already  modified  this  killer  move  and  used  it  many  times.</p>
<p>He  adjusted  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  time  flow  to  make  it  much   faster,  this  caused  calamities  and  tribulations  to  occur  more  frequently,  but   each  time,  Fang  Yuan  used  endless  trouble  killer  move  to  delay  them  to  the   next  tribulation.</p>
<p>Such  an  action  infuriated  heaven’s  will,  when  the  actual  tribulation  occurs,   it  would  be  extremely  strong.</p>
<p>For  this  was  a  flaw  that  Fang  Yuan  could  benefit  from.</p>
<p>Even  if  the  tribulations  erupted  with  the  anger  of  heaven’s  will  and  became   more  powerful,  Fang  Yuan  was  confident  of  passing  them  and  getting  a   large  number  of  dao  marks!</p>
