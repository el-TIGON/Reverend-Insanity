    <p>:  Natural  Inspiration</p>
<p>Southern  Border.</p>
<p>Deep  within  a  certain  Earth  Trench.</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  made  the  final  inspection  of  the  Gu  formation  and  confirmed   that  it  was  operational.</p>
<p>For  the  last  ten  or  so  days,  he  had  purposely  picked  this  location  and  set  up   several  Gu  formations  in  the  vicinity  of  over  ten  li.</p>
<p>“Although  I  am  not  specialized  in  formation  path,  I  can  still  create  some   simple  mortal  formations.  With  these  formations,  you  will  be  able  to   quickly  notice  any  peculiarities  in  the  surroundings.”</p>
<p>“You  have  my  guidance,  your  chance  of  success  at  immortal  ascension  is   high.”  Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  was  inside  Kong  Ri  Tian’s  mind,  he  said   with  some  confidence.</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  nodded:  ”Ancestor,  is  there  anything  else  I  need  to  know?”</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian  thought  about  it  and  said:  ”Don’t  be  greedy  during  the   natural  inspiration,  but  remember  to  make  good  use  of  it.  Since  you   cultivate  qi  path,  ask  heaven’s  will  questions  about  qi  path  related  matters,   don’t  go  after  the  secrets  of  other  paths,  it  will  not  be  worth  it.”</p>
<p>“Natural  inspiration  has  its  limits,  you  can’t  receive  an  infinite  amount  of   information.”</p>
<p>“Furthermore,  when  asking  qi  path  related  questions,  don’t  be  too  broad  or   demand  too  much.  Don’t  ask  for  rank  eight  or  nine  qi  path  Immortal  Gu   recipes,  you  won’t  receive  a  complete  one.  Even  if  you  obtain  an   incomplete  recipe,  it  may  not  even  have  five  percent  of  the  content!”</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  kept  these  words  in  his  mind  as  he  nodded:  ”Then  I’ll  ask  qi   path  related  questions  that  are  problems  that  I  currently  face.”</p>
<p>“That  is  the  right  thing  to  do.”  Kong  Sheng  Tian  laughed  loudly.</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  shattered  his  aperture  and  started  the  tribulation.</p>
<p>Heaven  and  earth  qi  surged  in  the  surroundings,  forming  a  three  days  flying   ring  tribulation.</p>
<p>The  flying  ring  was  powerful  and  soared  in  the  sky,  lasting  for  three  days   and  night.</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  resisted  with  difficulty,  eventually  becoming  a  rank  six  Gu   Immortal  with  a  high  grade  blessed  land.</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  sighed:  ”Your  luck  is  very  poor  to  have   encountered  such  a  tribulation.  This  tribulation  is  very  special,  it  will  last   for  three  days  and  nights,  even  if  you  destroy  the  ring,  it  will  regenerate.”</p>
<p>“To  protect  you,  I  expended  almost  all  my  immortal  essence.”</p>
<p>“I  told  you  not  to  provoke  that  Xiao  Yan.”</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  was  confused:  ”What  does  this  have  to  do  with  Xiao  Yan?”</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian  said:  ”Xiao  Yan’s  innate  luck  is  comparable  to  you  before   obtaining  Sheng  Tian  true  inheritance.  Most  importantly,  he  is  Shang  Xin   Ci’s  subordinate.  This  girl  has  incredible  luck,  going  against  Xiao  Yan  will   cause  your  luck  to  be  expended  against  Xiao  Yan  and  Shang  Xin  Ci.”</p>
<p>“Now  that  your  luck  is  low,  when  undergoing  tribulation,  the  three  days   flying  ring  tribulation  appeared  to  waste  all  of  my  remaining  immortal   essence.”</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  had  an  unsightly  expression.</p>
<p>Back  then,  he  attacked  Xiao  Yan  and  wanted  to  frame  it  on  the  demonic   path  Gu  Master  Bao  Tong.  In  the  end,  an  accident  occurred  as  he  did  not   expect  the  tap  fire  to  contain  an  immortal  material  flame.</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  was  not  a  Gu  Master  then,  he  did  not  want  to  waste  the   precious  immortal  essence  for  Kong  Sheng  Tian  to  use  his  immortal   method,  thus,  an  intense  battle  broke  out  and  the  tap  fire  was  dispersed,   causing  the  immortal  essence  flame  inside  to  explode.</p>
<p>The  immortal  material  flame  burned  the  entire  mountain  and  could  not  be   stopped,  Xiao  Yan  and  Bao  Tong  were  both  trapped  in  the  fire.</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  managed  to  escape  with  the  help  of  Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will.</p>
<p>To  think  that  the  backlash  of  that  decision  would  influence  Kong  Ri  Tian’s   immortal  ascension.</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian  sighed:  ”I  underestimated  that  Shang  Xin  Ci.  Unless  your   cultivation  level  and  battle  strength  surpasses  her  completely,  do  not   provoke  her  anymore.  Do  not  even  touch  anyone  who  is  close  to  her.”</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  gritted  his  teeth:  ”Ancestor,  are  you  exaggerating  this?”</p>
<p>“Hmph,  foolish  child.  Innate  luck[1.  There  are  a  lot  of  ways  to  write  luck  in   Chinese,  this  one  is  written  as  ’qi  variable’,  which  is  why  qi  path  is   involved.]  is  profound  and  mystical,  back  in  my  days  when  qi  path   dominated  the  world,  many  geniuses  were  able  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  it   profundity.”</p>
<p>“Do  not  underestimate  the  variance  of  luck.”</p>
<p>“Look  at  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.  I  believe  this  person  must  have   used  innate  luck  as  a  reference  when  he  created  luck  path.”</p>
<p>“You  have  already  become  a  Gu  Immortal,  you  should  learn  more.  Gu   cultivation  paths  are  not  independent  of  each  other,  they  influence  and</p>
<p>affect  each  other  in  a  connected  way.  The  connection  between  qi  path  and   luck  path  is  this  innate  luck.”</p>
<p>Eventually,  Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  convinced  Kong  Ri  Tian  after  a  lengthy   talk.</p>
<p>“Gu  Immortal  cultivation  is  far  more  profound  and  deep  than  Gu  Master   cultivation.  I  am  lucky  to  have  your  help,  ancestor,  otherwise,  I  would  have   to  undergo  immortal  ascension  without  knowing  anything!”  Kong  Ri  Tian   sighed.</p>
<p>Next,  he  consulted:  ”What  do  I  do  now,  what  is  the  most  important  thing?”</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  did  not  hesitate:  ”Little  fellow,  although  you   become  an  immortal,  there  is  not  enough  heaven  and  earth  qi  to  help  you   refine  your  vital  Gu  into  an  Immortal  Gu.”</p>
<p>“This  qi  path  Gu  worm  is  crucial  to  the  entire  Sheng  Tian  true  inheritance.”</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  understood  at  once:  ”So  now,  I  need  to  refine  that  Immortal   Gu?”</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  snorted  coldly:  ”Hehe,  the  ignorant  have  no  fear.   Do  you  think  you  can  refine  an  Immortal  Gu?  Even  if  you  go  bankrupt,  you   will  still  have  no  chance  of  success.”</p>
<p>“Do  you  know  that  most  rank  six  Gu  Immortals  do  not  even  own  one  rank   six  Immortal  Gu?  Most  rank  seven  Gu  Immortals  spend  their  lives  trying  to   get  a  rank  seven  Immortal  Gu.  This  is  true  even  for  venerables.  Go  and   think  about  how  hard  it  is  for  a  Gu  Immortal  to  refine  an  Immortal  Gu  that   suits  them!”</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  was  tongue-tied,  he  felt  shocked:  ”This  is  too  hard,  isn’t  it?”</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  sighed:  ”Gu  Immortal  cultivation  is  tough,  it  is   much  risker  than  being  a  Gu  Master.  Kid,  you  need  to  learn  to  survive  now.   Each  calamity  and  tribulation  is  a  test.  You  have  a  higher  starting  point  than</p>
<p>many  others,  but  you  cannot  act  rashly.  Especially  in  trying  to  refine  an   Immortal  Gu,  it  can  make  you  bankrupt  without  any  gains  in  return.”</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  was  troubled:  ”What  do  I  do  now?  Ancestor,  you  told  me  that   I  should  make  my  vital  Gu  an  Immortal  Gu,  but  you  also  told  me  that  I   cannot  refine  Immortal  Gu.  So  what  should  I  do?  Stop  beating  around  the   bush.”</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  snorted  again:  ”Kid,  are  you  willing  to  listen  to  me   now?  earlier,  I  told  you  time  and  again  not  to  provoke  that  Xiao  Yan,  but   what  did  you  do?  You  are  just  too  young!”</p>
<p>“Yes,  yes.”  Kong  Ri  Tian  quickly  apologized:  ”Ancestor,  from  now  on,  I   will  listen  to  you.”</p>
<p>Seeing  that  his  descendant  had  given  in,  Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  stopped   wasting  time,  he  said:  ”You  are  quite  lucky  to  have  a  refinement  path   venerable  like  Fang  Yuan  in  your  era.  Go  make  a  transaction  with  him  if   you  want  to  refine  Immortal  Gu.”</p>
<p>“Wait,  you  want  me  to  transact  with  him  in  treasure  yellow  heaven?  Aren’t   you  afraid…”</p>
<p>Before  Kong  Ri  Tian  could  continue,  Kong  Sheng  Tian  rebuked  him:  ”Do   you  think  a  grand  venerable  will  care  about  a  rank  six  Immortal  Gu?  I  know   what  you  are  afraid  of,  aren’t  you  afraid  that  Fang  Yuan  is  still  connected  to   Shang  Xin  Ci?  But  you  did  not  do  anything  to  her  either.”</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  heard  this  and  thought  about  it,  feeling  a  little  hurt  internally.</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  was  not  wrong.</p>
<p>In  Kong  Ri  Tian  and  Shang  Xin  Ci’s  encounters,  he  had  always  suffered  a   loss.  Last  time,  he  was  chased  after  by  Shang  Xin  Ci  and  Wu  Ji  because  of   Sheng  Tian  true  inheritance.  Afterwards,  he  also  suffered  losses  during  his   tribulation  after  provoking  Xiao  Yan.</p>
<p>Shang  Xin  Ci  was  having  a  great  life  now,  while  Kong  Ri  Tian  was   suffering  more  now.</p>
<p>“Let’s  go  to  treasure  yellow  heaven,  we  will  talk  to  Fang  Yuan’s  will.”   Eventually,  Kong  Ri  Tian  said.</p>
<p>Back  in  Western  Desert.</p>
<p>The  sandstorm  stopped.</p>
<p>Mo  Li  had  rank  six  cultivation  level,  he  bowed  deeply  at  the  featherman  Gu   Immortals  in  front  of  him.</p>
<p>“Friends  from  Yi  clan,  thank  you  for  the  help.  Otherwise,  I  would  not  have   been  able  to  become  a  Gu  Immortal  on  my  own.”  Mo  Li  thanked  them   sincerely.</p>
<p>Ever  since  the  contest  in  Sand  Heap  blessed  land,  he  was  saved  by  the   mysterious  super  force,  Yi  clan,  in  Western  Desert.</p>
<p>Mo  Li  came  to  Yi  clan’s  headquarters  and  after  interacting  with  them,  he   found  that  they  were  actually  all  feathermen.</p>
<p>This  time,  with  the  help  of  Yi  clan’s  Gu  Immortals,  Mo  Li  became  an   immortal.</p>
<p>Yi  clan’s  Gu  Immortal  Zhou  Yi  Kou  said:  ”Friend  Mo  Li,  you  are  too  polite.   You  are  one  who  obtained  Thieving  Heaven  true  inheritance,  that  means   you  are  his  inheritor.  Back  then,  our  Yi  clan’s  ancestor  was  helped  by  Lord   Thieving  Heaven  Demon  Venerable  and  survived.  With  the  help  of  his   method,  Yi  clan  was  able  to  stay  hidden  for  so  many  years.”</p>
<p>“Lord  Thieving  Heaven  Demon  Venerable  is  our  benefactor,  the  entire  Yi   clan  believes  that  Lord  Demon  Venerable  has  not  died  so  easily  without   making  a  sound!”</p>
<p>“By  helping  you  now,  we  also  want  to  repay  the  debt  we  owe  to  Lord   Thieving  Heaven.”</p>
<p>“If  one  day  in  the  future,  Lord  Thieving  Heaven  Demon  Venerable  revives,   our  entire  Yi  clan  will  follow  him  by  his  side.”</p>
<p>“Thus,  we  are  comrades.”</p>
<p>Mo  Li  was  deeply  moved  by  the  featherman  Gu  Immortal  Zhou  Yi  Kou’s   words,  he  had  a  warm  feeling  in  his  heart.</p>
<p>Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Wei  Wu  Shang  looked  at  the  qi  lump  in  his  immortal  aperture  with  a  heated   gaze.</p>
<p>Just  earlier,  he  had  succeeded  in  the  tribulation,  becoming  a  human  path  Gu   Immortal.</p>
<p>He  obtained  a  high  grade  blessed  land,  the  remaining  heaven  and  earth  qi   was  enough  for  him  to  refine  a  vital  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>His  vital  Gu  was  thief  Gu,  it  was  already  enveloped  in  heaven  and  earth  qi   now.</p>
<p>“I  heard  that  Gu  Ting,  Sun  Yuan  Hua,  and  the  rest  became  immortals  but   did  not  refine  a  human  path  Immortal  Gu.  I  am  different  from  them!”</p>
<p>“Recently,  while  deeply  asleep  at  night,  I  had  the  urge  to  pee  and  woke  up.   At  that  moment,  I  gained  a  burst  of  inspiration  and  comprehended  thief   Gu’s  Immortal  Gu  recipe.”</p>
<p>“With  this  Immortal  Gu  recipe  and  so  much  heaven  and  earth  qi  remaining,   I  can  definitely  refine  thief  Immortal  Gu.  Hahaha,  this  Immortal  Gu  recipe   is  worth  waking  up  to  pee  at  night.”</p>
<p>Although  Wei  Wu  Shang  entered  the  derivation  formation,  his  memories   were  altered  and  caused  him  to  think  that  it  was  inspiration  that  allowed   him  to  create  thief  Immortal  Gu’s  recipe.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>After  fifteen  minutes.</p>
<p>Wei  Wu  Shang  grunted  as  he  fell  to  the  ground.  The  heaven  and  earth  qi   were  completely  expended  while  his  vital  Gu  was  heavily  damaged.</p>
<p>“I  failed  the  Gu  refinement?”</p>
<p>“Impossible!”</p>
<p>Wei  Wu  Shang  could  not  believe  what  had  happened.</p>
<p>“To  refine  the  vital  Gu,  I  used  heaven  and  earth  qi.  This  is  borrowing  the   power  of  heaven  and  earth  to  refine  Gu,  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  my   refinement  path  attainment.  So  how  did  I  fail?”</p>
<p>Wei  Wu  Shang  could  only  think  of  one  explanation:  ”I  failed  because   Immortal  Gu  is  unique?!”</p>
<p>Thinking  of  this,  Wei  Wu  Shang  shook  his  head.</p>
<p>In  his  view,  this  was  even  more  impossible.</p>
<p>It  meant  that  someone  else  had  already  refined  thief  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>“I  am  the  creator  of  thief  Immortal  Gu,  how  can  anyone  get  the  recipe   before  me?  Unless…  thief  Immortal  Gu  already  exists  naturally  in  the   world?”</p>
<p>“But  that’s  also  strange…  human  path  should  not  have  developed  this   deeply  yet.”</p>
<p>Wei  Wu  Shang  fell  into  deep  confusion  as  he  contemplated.</p>
