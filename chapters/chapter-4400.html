        <p>:  Almost  Suffering  Amnesia  From  The  Explosion</p>
<p>With  a  soft  grunt,  Zhao  Lian  Yun  woke  up  in  an  area  of  ruins  and  rubble.</p>
<p>All  she  saw  were  qi  currents  in  front  of  her,  the  entire  place  was  covered  in   white,  in  all  directions.</p>
<p>Her  ears  were  buzzing,  she  felt  dizzy  and  lightheaded.</p>
<p>“What…  what  happened  to  me?”</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  breathed  roughly  as  she  inspected  her  body.</p>
<p>She  was  originally  wearing  a  white  dress,  she  had  light  skin  and  white  teeth,   as  refreshing  as  lilies  in  the  morning.  But  now,  her  face  was  blackened  like   soot,  her  white  dress  was  torn  and  tattered.  She  was  like  a  refugee  living  in   a  famine,  having  a  wretched  appearance.</p>
<p>After  checking,  she  found  that  her  body  was  intact  but  she  had  no  strength   at  all,  her  limbs  felt  weak  and  powerless.</p>
<p>“What  happened?  Why  am  I  like  this?”</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin’s  explosion  occurred  too  suddenly  and  abruptly,  Zhao   Lian  Yun  suffered  a  huge  impact  and  almost  experienced  amnesia!</p>
<p>But  soon,  her  dizziness  faded  away  and  Zhao  Lian  Yun  slowly  regained  her   memories.</p>
<p>An  unprecedented  and  terrifying  explosion  had  occurred!!!!</p>
<p>Her  pupils  contracted,  this  scene  was  etched  in  her  mind  and  would  not  be   forgotten  in  her  entire  life.</p>
<p>It  was  too  terrifying!</p>
<p>A  moment  ago,  the  many  Gu  Immortals  around  her  were  watching  the   mountain-like  qi  harvest  fruit  with  immense  anticipation  for  Primordial   Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival.</p>
<p>But  at  the  next  moment,  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  exploded!</p>
<p>Among  all  of  the  Gu  Immortals,  Zhao  Lian  Yun  was  standing  near  the   periphery,  but  she  was  still  affected  by  the  explosion.</p>
<p>This  explosion  was  too  intense,  the  whole  of  Heavenly  Court  was  in  ruins,   Zhao  Lian  Yun  naturally  could  not  escape.</p>
<p>“Why  did  it  explode  all  of  a  sudden?!”  As  her  memories  cleared  up,  Zhao   Lian  Yun’s  breathing  became  rougher.</p>
<p>“I  can’t  believe  it,  I  am  practically  unharmed.  Did  love  Gu  protect  me?”</p>
<p>“Wait…  I  need  to  save  the  rest!”</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun’s  heart  jumped,  she  realized  what  she  should  be  doing.</p>
<p>She  might  have  had  love  Gu’s  protection,  but  others  did  not  have  a  rank   nine  Immortal  Gu  like  her.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  quickly  set  off  as  she  went  into  the  vast  field  of  qi  currents,   searching  for  other  surviving  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Before  the  explosion  occurred,  the  Gu  Immortals  of  the  ten  great  ancient   sects  were  all  at  the  periphery,  they  were  far  apart  and  watched  the  qi</p>
<p>harvest  fruit  in  small  groups.  The  people  who  were  closer  to  the  center  were   the  members  of  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>White  qi  rumbled  like  a  vast  fog,  Zhao  Lian  Yun  tried  many  investigative   methods  but  none  worked.</p>
<p>These  white  qi  were  remnants  of  the  qi  harvest  fruit,  the  aftermath  of  the   explosion!  With  the  area  being  filled  with  qi  path  dao  marks,  it  was  not   strange  that  a  mere  rank  six  Gu  Immortal  like  Zhao  Lian  Yun  was  unable  to   use  investigative  methods,  unless  she  could  use  love  Gu  now.</p>
<p>But  love  Gu  was  not  just  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,  it  was  very  special.  Even   a  venerable  could  not  refine  it  forcefully,  even  though  it  was  wisdom  path,   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  not  been  able  to  use  it.  Thus,  it   continued  to  live  in  Zhao  Lian  Yun’s  body.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  did  not  refine  love  Gu  but  received  its  acknowledgement   instead.  Thus,  she  could  not  activate  it  freely,  sometimes,  she  wanted  it  to   attack  but  it  would  escape  with  her.  If  she  wanted  it  to  defend,  it  might  heal   instead.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  each  time  love  Gu  was  used,  it  would  take  something  away   from  Zhao  Lian  Yun,  sometimes,  it  would  even  take  lifespan!</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  flew  into  the  white  qi  and  looked  around  for  people  using   her  memories  of  the  location.</p>
<p>After  a  while,  she  gasped  as  she  found  Bu  Zhen  Zi.</p>
<p>When  the  explosion  occurred,  he  was  standing  beside  her,  they  were   talking.</p>
<p>But  after  the  explosion,  they  were  sent  flying  and  left  their  original  spot.</p>
<p>But  he  was  still  the  first  person  she  found.</p>
<p>Bu  Zhen  Zi’s  injuries  were  terrifying.</p>
<p>Half  his  body  was  blown  away,  only  his  fragile  skeleton  was  left  protecting   his  heart.  He  only  had  two  internal  organs  left,  the  rest  were  blown  to   smithereens.</p>
<p>The  remaining  half  of  Bu  Zhen  Zi’s  body  had  turned  into  a  phantom  state,   his  limbs,  chest,  and  internal  organs  were  linked  by  a  translucent  thread,  he   seemed  to  be  in  a  stable  condition.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  wanted  to  save  him  but  found  that  she  was  helpless  to  do   anything.</p>
<p>The  injuries  were  just  too  severe!</p>
<p>The  missing  half  of  his  body  was  not  important,  forget  about  Heavenly   Court,  even  Spirit  Affinity  House  had  many  ways  to  regrow  his  bones,   organs,  and  flesh.</p>
<p>But  the  issue  was  the  large  number  of  qi  path  dao  marks  that  were  carved   on  his  body.</p>
<p>The  remaining  half  of  his  body  emitted  dense  white  smoke  made  of  white   qi,  his  remaining  organs  and  bones  were  also  slowly  turning  into  qi.</p>
<p>What  kept  him  alive  was  the  phantom  state  that  half  of  his  body  was   currently  in.</p>
<p>“When  the  explosion  occurred,  Bu  Zhen  Zi  used  a  phantom  path  method,   but  even  with  this  semi-invulnerable  state,  he  could  not  avoid  the  injuries   caused  by  this  explosion.”</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  deduced  the  situation  that  happened  and  sighed  deeply,   worry  and  frustration  could  be  seen  on  her  face.</p>
<p>Bu  Zhen  Zi  was  kept  alive  by  his  half  phantom  body,  but  this  would  not  last   long.  The  qi  path  dao  marks  were  going  to  affect  it  soon,  slowly  turning   everything  into  qi.</p>
<p>“Bu  Zhen  Zi  can’t  last  much  longer…”  Zhao  Lian  Yun  was  helpless,  she   felt  increasingly  anxious.</p>
<p>She  tried  to  wake  him  up  but  Bu  Zhen  Zi  remained  unconscious.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  did  not  even  dare  to  move  Bu  Zhen  Zi,  she  was  afraid  that   he  would  die  from  the  smallest  impact.</p>
<p>She  had  to  temporarily  abandon  him  and  remember  this  spot,  before  going   back  into  the  white  qi  fog  to  look  for  others.</p>
<p>“Is  anyone  here?  Please  help!”</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  moved  around  in  the  vast  white  qi  fog.</p>
<p>She  called  out  continuously,  the  feeling  of  loneliness  and  helplessness  soon   assaulted  her  in  this  situation.</p>
<p>She  was  still  in  disbelief.</p>
<p>When  she  came  earlier,  she  looked  at  the  layers  of  buildings  and  saw  how   grand  and  majestic  Heavenly  Court  was,  she  felt  surprise  and  admiration   from  the  depths  of  her  heart.  Heavenly  Court’s  immense  foundation  was   accumulated  through  countless  years  of  history,  she  felt  tiny  and   insignificant,  while  also  having  a  sense  of  security  in  this  place.</p>
<p>When  she  witnessed  the  gradual  revival  of  Primordial  Origin  Immortal   Venerable,  she  felt  that  Heavenly  Court  was  regaining  its  former  glory!</p>
<p>But  then,  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  exploded.</p>
<p>It  was  too  sudden  and  too  abrupt!</p>
<p>“What  happened?  Did  Fang  Yuan  or  the  other  venerables  attack?”</p>
<p>“What  are  Heavenly  Court’s  losses?”</p>
<p>“Can  anyone  come  to  help  me?  At  least  respond  with  a  word!”</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  suddenly  stopped  moving,  there  was  an  intense  suction   force  coming  from  in  front  of  her,  the  surrounding  white  qi  currents  were   sucked  in.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  barely  stabilized  her  footing  as  she  slowly  got  close.</p>
<p>The  suction  force  was  becoming  gradually  weaker.</p>
<p>After  Zhao  Lian  Yun  reached  the  source,  her  pupils  contracted  as  she  saw   an  immortal  aperture’s  entrance!</p>
<p>The  entrance  was  open  and  drawing  in  white  qi  from  outside,  after   stabilizing,  a  blessed  land  was  formed.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  stood  before  the  immortal  aperture’s  entrance  in  a  daze,   motionless.</p>
<p>She  saw  the  scenery  inside  the  entrance,  there  were  rivers  and  flower  trees.   Under  the  waves  of  qi  currents,  petals  fell  from  the  trees  and  fell  into  the   rivers,  flowing  downstream  where  the  carps  waited  to  eat  the  petals  as  food.</p>
<p>This  was  the  scene  of  Fairy  Liu  Fang’s  immortal  aperture,  it  was  extremely   beautiful  and  valuable,  it  was  quite  famous  in  Spirit  Affinity  House.</p>
<p>Fairy  Liu  Fang  was  in  charge  of  the  secret  inheritance  peak,  she  was  a   neutral  faction  supreme  elder  in  Spirit  Affinity  House.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  remembered  that  the  first  time  she  went  to  secret  inheritance   peak,  Fairy  Liu  Fang  did  not  attend  to  her  personally  which  was  the  rule  as   she  was  the  current  generation  fairy.</p>
<p>Afterwards,  their  relationship  had  always  been  plain.</p>
<p>However,  no  matter  how  distant  they  were,  seeing  this  immortal  aperture   entrance,  Zhao  Lian  Yun’s  eyes  turned  red,  she  felt  an  intense  feeling  of   sorrow  in  her  heart.</p>
<p>She  was  dead.</p>
<p>Fairy  Liu  Fang  died  during  the  explosion.</p>
<p>Although  she  had  rank  seven  cultivation  level,  she  did  not  have  the   defensive  power  of  phantom  path,  she  did  not  have  love  Gu  either.</p>
<p>Not  a  single  trace  of  her  remained,  her  immortal  aperture  landed  in   Heavenly  Court.  Because  Heavenly  Court  was  filled  with  heaven’s  will  and   had  no  heavenly  spirit,  Liu  Fang  blessed  land  was  formed  by  taking  in   heaven  and  earth  qi  from  outside  to  stabilize  itself.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  barely  managed  to  control  her  emotions,  she  continued  to   look  around  for  help.</p>
<p>Along  the  way,  she  saw  many  immortal  aperture  entrances  which  were   currently  taking  in  heaven  and  earth  qi.</p>
<p>There  were  too  many  deaths!</p>
<p>“Not  mentioning  the  Heavenly  Court  members,  Central  Continent’s  ten   great  ancient  sects  sent  more  than  ten  Gu  Immortals  each.  Not  counting  the   captives  in  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  there  are  over  a  hundred  Gu   Immortals  from  the  ten  sects  in  Heavenly  Court  now.”</p>
<p>“This  explosion  killed  eighty  percent  of  the  Gu  Immortals!”</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  calculated,  she  felt  her  heart  turning  cold.</p>
<p>The  ten  great  ancient  sects  of  Central  Continent  had  many  Gu  Immortals,   before  the  five  regions  became  one,  Immortal  Crane  Sect  alone  had  twelve   Gu  Immortals,  and  this  was  one  of  the  weakest  sects  among  the  ten.</p>
<p>After  the  five  regions  became  one,  the  earth  veins  moved  while  qi  tides   appeared,  producing  countless  immortal  materials.  This  caused  many  Gu   Immortals  within  the  sects  to  become  stronger,  the  Gu  Immortal  seeds  also   had  deeper  foundations.</p>
<p>During  the  wave  of  immortal  ascension,  many  Gu  Immortal  seeds  in  the  ten   great  ancient  sects  succeeded  in  becoming  Gu  Immortals.  Aside  from  them,   there  were  also  other  Gu  Immortals  recruited  from  outside.</p>
<p>For  example,  supreme  elder  Wu  Zhang  from  Heavenly  Lotus  Sect  recruited   the  Wood  Virtue  Elder  Mu  Huai  from  the  Five  Virtues  Sect.  After  the  latter   became  an  immortal,  because  he  was  a  higher-up  of  the  Five  Virtues  Sect   that  Wu  Zhang  created,  he  was  qualified  to  enter  Heavenly  Lotus  Sect.</p>
<p>This  was  the  advantage  of  Central  Continent’s  sect  system.</p>
<p>Earlier,  to  ensure  Primordial  Origin’s  revival,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  gave  up  everything  else  in  the  process.  To  prevent  Fang  Yuan’s   retaliation,  she  brought  all  the  elites  of  Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient   sects  into  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>But  to  think  that  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  would  explode   upon  revival,  like  this,  many  of  Central  Continent’s  Gu  Immortals  died,  the   pillars  of  Central  Continent’s  righteous  path  collapsed.</p>
<p>Such  a  terrifying  loss  made  Zhao  Lian  Yun’s  arms  and  legs  turn  weak.</p>
<p>“Doomed,  Central  Continent  is  doomed.”</p>
<p>“Maybe  Heavenly  Court  can  still  revive  them?”  Zhao  Lian  Yun  was   hopeful.</p>
<p>But  she  was  not  stupid,  the  more  she  thought  about  it,  the  more  she  sensed   that  there  was  a  huge  scheme  behind  this  explosion!</p>
<p>Central  Continent  was  plotted  against.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  fell  into  a  trap!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  also  fell  for  a  scheme!</p>
<p>Although  Zhao  Lian  Yun  had  rank  nine  love  Gu,  she  was  only  rank  six,   what  could  she  do?</p>
<p>She  could  only  get  help,  she  shouted  loudly.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  started  walking  slower  and  slower.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  she  felt  that  she  was  so  weak!</p>
<p>“Don’t  be  dejected,  current  generation  fairy  of  Spirit  Affinity  House,   Heavenly  Court  is  still  around,  we  are  also  still  alive.”  Right  at  this   moment,  there  was  a  lantern  that  brightened  inside  the  vast  white  qi.</p>
<p>The  lantern  was  not  bright  but  it  was  stubborn,  it  forced  its  way  out  of  the   white  qi  and  arrived  before  Zhao  Lian  Yun.</p>
<p>It  was  an  elderly  Gu  Immortal,  his  body  was  bloodstained  from  head  to  toe.</p>
<p>One  of  his  arms  was  gone  from  the  explosion,  his  remaining  arm  was   carrying  a  small  fire  in  his  palm.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  recognized  him,  it  was  Immortal  Crane  Sect’s  Old  Lord  Can   Yang.</p>
