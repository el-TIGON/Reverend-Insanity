    <h1>Chapter  2319</h1>
    <p>:  Star  Constellation  Admits  Defeat</p>
<p>Heaven  and  earth  was  torn  apart  like  a  huge  opened  mouth.  Endless   lightning  exploded  and  resisted  the  fierce  tornadoes.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  floated  in  the  air  and  observed  the  land.</p>
<p>“Lightning,  come!”  He  shouted  and  at  the  next  moment,  tens  of  thousands   of  lightning  balls  fell  from  the  sky  and  collided  with  the  tornadoes,  causing   huge  explosions.</p>
<p>Ten  or  so  tornadoes  were  destroyed  but  there  were  still  about  a  hundred   tornadoes  which  connected  the  small  world’s  sky  and  ground  like  giant   pillars.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  gritted  his  teeth  as  he  recognized  the  crucial  point:  He  had   to  find  the  location  of  this  dream  realm’s  land  spirit  as  soon  as  possible  and   attack  it.  Otherwise,  with  so  many  tornadoes,  even  if  he  destroyed  all  of   them,  he  would  have  used  all  his  strength  which  was  detrimental  to  his   future  dream  realm  explorations.</p>
<p>With  the  main  body’s  protection,  after  experiencing  that  thrilling  moment   before,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  did  not  run  into  anymore  mishaps.</p>
<p>He  continued  to  explore  the  heaven  path  dream  realms,  not  only  raising  his   heaven  path  attainment  level  greatly  but  also  raising  his  strength  in  the   dream  realm  immortal  aperture.  He  became  a  heavenly  spirit  and  his   methods  were  at  a  completely  different  level  than  before.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  could  now  control  heavenly  power  and  produce  strength   similar  to  calamities  and  tribulations!</p>
<p>Moreover,  he  also  found  that  heaven  path  dream  realms  could  annex  each   other,  constantly  bringing  him  risks  as  well  as  opportunities  in  the   explorations.</p>
<p>“Ice,  come!”  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  seized  the  timing,  his  two  small  hands  spread   apart  and  pressed  down.</p>
<p>Hailstones  rained  down  heavily  from  the  sky.</p>
<p>The  hailstones  continued  to  grow  bigger  every  moment,  some  of  them  were   even  as  large  as  a  hill  in  just  a  few  breaths  of  time.</p>
<p>These  hailstones  fell  on  the  tornadoes  and  were  rapidly  swept  away.</p>
<p>The  dark-green  tornadoes  were  soon  covered  by  a  layer  of  bluish  white   frost  and  their  speed  fell  sharply.</p>
<p>“So  it  was  here.”  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  succeeded  in  weakening  the  enemy  and   discovered  that  there  was  a  white  feather  flying  fish  hiding  in  the  leftmost   tornado.</p>
<p>This  white  feather  flying  fish  was  the  heavenly  spirit  of  the  other  dream   realm  immortal  aperture!</p>
<p>Heaven  path  dream  realms  could  annex  each  other,  this  current   manifestation  was  the  result  of  the  two  dream  realm  immortal  apertures   annexing  each  other.  As  the  heavenly  spirit  of  a  dream  realm  immortal   aperture,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  had  to  lead  his  dream  realm  immortal  aperture  to   suppress  the  other  side’s  dream  realm  immortal  aperture  and  even  annex  it.</p>
<p>There  was  a  crucial  step  in  this,  that  was  to  find  the  other  side’s  heavenly   spirit  and  exterminate  it.</p>
<p>“Die!”  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  used  one  method  after  the  other,  the  flying  fish   heavenly  spirit  got  dizzy  from  seeing  all  the  attacks.</p>
<p>Lighting  flashed,  thunder  rumbled,  storm  brewed,  meteors  fell,  and  lava   gushed  out;  all  kinds  of  attacks  were  thrown  out  before  the  flying  fish   heavenly  spirit  was  finally  exterminated.</p>
<p>Without  the  control  of  the  heavenly  spirit,  the  tornadoes  still  existed  but   were  moving  disorderly  instead  of  being  orderly  like  before,  immediately   becoming  non-threatening.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  dream  realm  immortal  aperture  also   quickened  the  pace  of  annexing  the  enemy  dream  realm  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>With  the  flying  fish  heavenly  spirit  dead,  it  was  like  the  opposing  army’s   commander  was  beheaded,  they  would  fall  into  disorder  and  be  defeated  no   matter  how  strong  they  were.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  followed  up  his  victory  and  finally  expanded  his  dream   realm  immortal  aperture  by  another  area.</p>
<p>“There  is  a  huge  rise  in  wind  path  dao  marks,  the  outcome  is  pretty  good.   Hmm?  Another  dream  realm  immortal  aperture  is  coming  close.”  Meng  Qiu   Zhen  had  not  even  rested  when  he  saw  an  indistinct  red  shadow  appear   outside  the  dream  realm  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>The  indistinct  red  shadow  covered  the  sky  and  ground,  obscuring  the  sun   and  moon.  A  huge  explosion  resounded  as  it  collided  with  Meng  Qiu   Zhen’s  dream  realm  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>The  immortal  aperture’s  boundary  was  broken  as  the  two  dream  realm   immortal  apertures  connected  to  each  other  and  started  a  brutal  annexing   process.</p>
<p>“Wait,  this  heavenly  spirit  is  different!”  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s  expression   changed  slightly  as  he  discovered  that  the  enemy  was  extremely  shrewd  and   could  adapt  to  the  situation  easily  with  plenty  of  methods  that  were  not   fewer  than  Meng  Qiu  Zhen’s.</p>
<p>“Don’t  tell  me…”</p>
<p>Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>Qi  tides  surged  and  formed  tens  of  thousands  of  qi  monsters  everywhere,   forming  a  huge  calamity.</p>
<p>A  large  number  of  mortals  in  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  became   corpses  under  the  rampage  of  the  qi  monsters.</p>
<p>“Damn  it!”</p>
<p>“We  must  persevere!”</p>
<p>“These  qi  monsters  are  coming  endlessly,  when  will  it  stop?”</p>
<p>The  Gu  Immortals  of  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  used  all  their   strength  to  defend,  Old  Immortal  Hua  Yu  personally  entered  the  battle  and   was  barely  able  to  hold  the  situation.</p>
<p>This  was  not  a  heavenly  tribulation  or  earthly  calamity,  it  was  the  qi  path   killer  move  that  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  used  to  attack  the  star  array  calculation   formation.</p>
<p>The  star  array  calculation  formation  had  a  large  number  of  formation  cores.   After  a  number  of  the  formation  cores’  Immortal  Gu  were  destroyed  by   Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones,  the  formation  bases  were  exposed.</p>
<p>These  formation  bases  were  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven,  Skeleton   grotto-heaven,  and  so  on.</p>
<p>As  long  as  these  grotto-heavens  were  destroyed,  the  star  array  calculation   formation  would  lose  its  foundation  and  collapse  completely.</p>
<p>“If  we  had  known  this  earlier,  why  would  we  try  all  means  possible  to   defect?”</p>
<p>“Sigh,  it  is  already  too  late  to  say  this.  We  can  only  hope  that  Lady  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  has  enough  methods  to  protect  our   homeland.”</p>
<p>These  grotto-heaven  Gu  Immortals  were  feeling  regret  to  some  extent.</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>An  explosion  rang,  qi  currents  rampaged  like  ten  thousand  horses  as  Qi  Sea   Ancestor  gradually  appeared  inside  Skeleton  grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>Granny  Skeleton  was  in  despair  but  before  she  even  asked  for  help,  many   rank  eight  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  arrived  in  Skeleton  grotto-heaven   in  Immortal  Gu  Houses.</p>
<p>Without  any  delay,  a  huge  battle  erupted!</p>
<p>Heaven  and  earth  shook,  qi  sea  rose,  golden  lights  flew,  jade  water  floated   in  the  sky…  a  large  number  of  killer  moves  were  activated,  their  aftershock   creating  huge  casualties.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Unlimited  Qi  Sea!</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  continued  to  gather  his  momentum  before  finally  using  this   move.</p>
<p>With  one  move,  heaven  and  earth  was  overturned,  several  Immortal  Gu   Houses  of  Heavenly  Court  were  damaged  heavily,  one  even  crumbled  apart.</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  and  the  rest  coughed  blood  repeatedly  from  the  serious   injuries.</p>
<p>“Hold  on!”  Qin  Ding  Ling  shouted.</p>
<p>“Watch  this!”  Che  Wei  tried  bravely  to  use  offense  against  offense.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  struck  by  his  killer  move  and  suffered  some  injuries.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Qi  Jue  Revival!</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  a  large  number  of  qi  path  immortal  materials  was   expended  as  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  recovered  rapidly.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  turned  pale.</p>
<p>“Let’s  end  this.”</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  gave  a  shout  and  activated  the  killer  move,  Hu  elevation!</p>
<p>Towering  and  terrifying  qi  pillars  shot  out,  directly  piercing  through   Skeleton  grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>Granny  Skeleton’s  eyes  were  wide  open  and  had  no  time  to  dodge,  she  was   annihilated  by  the  qi  pillar  with  not  even  a  small  piece  of  her  remaining.</p>
<p>Skeleton  grotto-heaven  was  heavily  damaged  and  started  to  produce  the   winds  of  assimilation.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  left  from  the  large  hole  while  Qi  Sea   Ancestor  gave  chase.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  saw  this  from  inside  Embroidered  Tower  and  was   about  to  make  a  move  when  Zhan  Bu  Du  charged  inside  the  formation   space.</p>
<p>“It  is  here  after  all!”  Wu  Shuai  was  happy.</p>
<p>He  controlled  ants  to  infiltrate  the  depths  of  the  star  array  calculation   formation  and  forcibly  drilled  a  pathway  from  which  Zhan  Bu  Du  squeezed   inside.</p>
<p>The  Gu  Immortals  inside  the  formation  space  were  mostly  from  ten  great   ancient  sects;  although  they  were  all  elites,  they  were  still  far  from  reaching   the  level  of  Heavenly  Court’s  members.</p>
<p>Even  the  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  could  not  easily  fight  a  pseudo   venerable,  let  alone  them.</p>
<p>Zhan  Bu  Du  was  like  a  tiger  entering  a  herd  of  sheep,  blood  started  to  flow   instantly.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  heaved  a  sigh,  she  could  only  give  up  on  targeting   Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  activated  Embroidered  Tower  to  block  Zhan  Bu  Du.</p>
<p>After  a  period  of  stalemate,  Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones  finally  created  an   opening  and  started  destroying  the  star  array  calculation  formation  as  easily   as  cutting  bamboo.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  was  beaten  back  again  and  again  without  getting  any   chance  to  stabilize  their  footing.</p>
<p>This  news  immediately  reached  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sighed  as  she  activated  two  human   path  killer  moves.</p>
<p>One  was  heroes  among  people  and  the  other  was  hope  of  the  people.</p>
<p>Divine  Emperor  City  which  was  the  largest  human  vein  node  of  Central   Continent  released  countless  white  light.  The  countless  specks  and  lumps  of   light  were  like  lanterns  or  candles.</p>
<p>These  lights  moved  like  fish  or  birds  returning  to  their  homes,  landing  in  all   of  the  Gu  Immortals  inside  the  star  array  calculation  formation,  forming  a   dense  white  radiance.</p>
<p>The  white  radiance  started  to  shrink  while  the  Gu  Immortals’  auras  started   to  grow.</p>
<p>Just  like  in  the  fate  war,  they  received  a  huge  amplification  once  again.</p>
<p>“As  expected,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  used  this  move,  it   hasn’t  crossed  Lord  Alliance  Leader’s  calculations.”  Lu  Wei  Yin  was   watching  Divine  Emperor  City  from  some  distance  with  a  moved   expression.</p>
<p>“She  is  using  the  same  ability  again,  it  means  she  ran  out  of  tricks.”  Shen   Shang  smiled  lightly  as  he  attacked  Divine  Emperor  City  with  Lu  Wei  Yin.</p>
<p>Genesis  Lotus’  will  and  Qing  Chou  were  guarding  Divine  Emperor  City.  As   they  were  attacked  by  two  experts,  they  could  only  stop  supporting  the  two   human  path  killer  moves  and  defend  themselves.</p>
<p>Spectral  heaven  battlefield.</p>
<p>The  white  radiance  formed  from  the  human  path  killer  moves  similarly   covered  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>The  two  received  the  amplification,  their  strength  rose  by  a  huge  degree!</p>
<p>“As  expected  of  human  path  methods,  even  a  venerable  like  me  can  benefit   from  it.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  clicked  his  tongue  in  praise.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  frowned:  ”There  are  almost  no   heaven  path  dream  realms  left,  we’ve  lost  this  battle!”</p>
