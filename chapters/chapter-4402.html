    <p>:  Pitiful  Survivors</p>
<p>Old  Lord  Can  Yang  was  a  famous  expert  in  Central  Continent,  his   reputation  was  long  established.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  looked  at  him,  some  information  surfaced  in  her  mind.  After   becoming  the  current  generation  fairy  of  Spirit  Affinity  House,  because  she   could  not  undergo  tribulations,  her  cultivation  level  could  not  rise.  She   could  only  spend  her  time  on  other  things,  thus,  she  had  a  clear   understanding  of  most  characters  in  Central  Continent’s  Gu  Immortal   world.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  knew  that  that  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  had  the  Immortal  Gu   Flickering  Flame,  he  created  an  amazing  immortal  killer  move  called  life   chasing  fire,  it  was  renowned  in  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Old  Lord  Can  Yang  rarely  moved  around  these  last  years,  he  had  been   staying  in  seclusion.</p>
<p>The  most  significant  thing  he  did  recently  was  to  investigate  the  truth   behind  the  fall  of  Eighty-Eight  True  Yang  Building  in  Northern  Plains  with   Feng  Jiu  Ge,  they  fought  against  Shadow  Sect  there.</p>
<p>And  recently,  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  won  the  contest  against  Zhang  Ji.</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji  was  a  Gu  Immortal  from  Black  Heaven  Temple,  although  he  was  a   relatively  unknown  expert,  he  had  a  unique  method  to  counter  flames.  In   the  end,  he  still  lost  to  the  fire  path  cultivator  Old  Lord  Can  Yang.</p>
<p>Although  the  lantern  in  Old  Lord  Can  Yang’s  hand  was  weak,  it  produced  a   warm  feeling  in  Zhao  Lian  Yun’s  heart  instantly.</p>
<p>Many  people  were  like  this,  they  were  often  fragile  and  weak  when  they   were  lonely.</p>
<p>But  if  a  companion  appeared,  even  if  this  person  was  useless,  the  company   they  provided  would  still  create  a  sense  of  warmth  and  safety  in  their  heart.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  was  such  a  person.</p>
<p>She  was  an  otherworldly  demon  who  was  not  originally  from  this  world.   Her  nature  was  already  like  this  before  she  came  here,  that  was  one  of  the   reasons  why  she  felt  so  attached  to  Ma  Hong  Yun  after  receiving  his  care   and  concern.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  breathed  in  deeply,  the  look  of  dejectedness  on  her  face   quickly  faded  away  as  she  asked  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  for  help,  she  explained   Bu  Zhen  Zi’s  condition.</p>
<p>But  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  shook  his  head  slowly:  ”I  cultivate  fire  path,  my   understanding  of  phantom  path  is  very  shallow,  I  am  not  skilled  in  healing   methods.  There  is  nothing  I  can  do.”</p>
<p>Once  he  said  that,  Old  Lord  Can  Yang’s  body  started  to  shiver  at  an   observable  level.</p>
<p>His  face  turned  pale  as  paper.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  white  qi  appeared  on  his  body,  it  was  most  dense  around   the  wound  on  his  arm  that  was  cut  off.</p>
<p>“Cough  cough.”</p>
<p>Old  Lord  Can  Yang  continued  to  cough,  each  time,  blood  was  coughed  out.</p>
<p>The  blood  fell  to  the  ground  and  turned  into  white  qi,  quickly  dissipating.</p>
<p>Old  Lord  Can  Yang  gritted  his  teeth  and  activated  his  method,  this  situation   lasted  for  over  ten  breaths  of  time  before  he  suppressed  his  wounds  again,   color  returned  to  his  face  and  his  coughing  stopped.</p>
<p>His  methods  were  only  usable  on  himself,  or  rather,  only  fire  path  Gu   Immortals,  they  would  not  work  on  Bu  Zhen  Zi.  In  fact,  they  could  make   his  condition  worse.</p>
<p>Next,  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  and  Zhao  Lian  Yun  moved  together.</p>
<p>Along  the  way,  they  saw  more  immortal  aperture  entrances,  which  were   open  and  absorbing  white  qi  wildly.</p>
<p>They  also  saw  some  people  who  were  alive.</p>
<p>There  was  a  giant  monkey  lying  on  the  ground,  he  was  like  a  small   mountain.</p>
<p>The  monkey  was  originally  covered  in  golden  hair,  like  there  was  armor  on   the  body.  But  now,  half  the  body  was  blackened,  he  was  like  a  fallen   general  who  had  lost  his  armor.</p>
<p>His  muscles  were  originally  strong  and  tough,  he  looked  very  powerful  and   brave,  but  now,  his  body  was  covered  in  mushy  flesh  and  blood,  bones   could  be  seen  on  his  deeper  wounds,  he  sprawled  on  the  ground  and  could   not  get  up.</p>
<p>The  monkey  had  a  pair  of  golden  eyes  that  were  shining  with  pressuring   brilliance,  but  now,  his  gaze  was  scattered  and  lost,  he  only  regained  some   spirit  after  seeing  Zhao  Lian  Yun  and  Old  Lord  Can  Yang.</p>
<p>“What?  He  is  Combat  Immortal  Sect’s  Immortal  Monkey  King  Shi  Lei.  He   cultivates  earth  path  and  transformation  path,  he  is  currently  using  his   signature  killer  move  —  Rock  Mountain  Immortal  Monkey  King   Transformation!”  Zhao  Lian  Yun  was  stunned,  having  recognized  the   monkey’s  identity  instantly.</p>
<p>Shi  Lei  was  the  publicly  known  number  one  rank  seven  Gu  Immortal  in   Central  Continent,  his  battle  strength  was  even  higher  than  Old  Lord  Can   Yang!</p>
<p>But  he  was  even  closer  to  the  explosion  than  Old  Lord  Can  Yang,  after  it   happened,  he  did  not  have  time  to  activate  his  rock  mountain  immortal   monkey  king  transformation.</p>
<p>This  was  a  compound  killer  move  of  two  paths,  it  expended  a  lot  of   thoughts.</p>
<p>Shi  Lei  did  not  have  wisdom  path  foundation,  he  needed  a  lot  of  preparation   to  use  this  move.</p>
<p>He  used  other  methods  to  survive  the  explosion,  afterwards,  because  he   could  not  heal  himself,  he  had  to  use  this  move  to  turn  himself  into  an   ancient  desolate  beast.  Using  the  physique  of  an  ancient  desolate  beast,  its   self-recovery  allowed  him  to  endure  these  injuries  and  barely  survive.</p>
<p>After  seeing  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  and  Zhao  Lian  Yun,  Shi  Lei  blinked  at   them  with  his  golden  eyes  as  a  greeting.</p>
<p>He  did  not  even  dare  to  breathe  heavily  now,  it  would  be  a  problem  if  his   injuries  were  worsened.</p>
<p>Evidently,  Shi  Lei  could  only  protect  himself  now,  he  could  not  help  others.</p>
<p>“Cough,  cough.”  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  coughed  again,  blood  could  be  seen   again.  A  moment  later,  he  suppressed  his  injuries  again.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  and  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  continued  on  their  journey.</p>
<p>Not  long  after,  they  met  Yang  Feng.</p>
<p>He  was  a  rank  seven  Gu  Immortal  of  Ancient  Soul  Sect,  he  cultivated   transformation  path.  Like  Shi  Lei,  he  had  also  turned  himself  into  an   ancient  desolate  beast.</p>
<p>The  originally  majestic  giant  wolf  was  lying  on  the  ground  like  a  beaten   dog.</p>
<p>But  his  injuries  were  less  severe  than  those  of  Shi  Lei,  he  could  still  talk  to   Zhao  Lian  Yun.</p>
<p>He  was  not  stronger  than  Shi  Lei,  but  during  the  explosion,  he   subconsciously  used  the  transformation  killer  move  that  he  was  most   familiar  with  and  turned  into  an  ancient  desolate  beast.</p>
<p>He  cultivated  transformation  path  solely,  he  was  most  familiar  with  this   giant  wolf  transformation,  it  was  almost  like  his  instinct.  Thus,  it  could  be   used  rapidly,  almost  activating  in  an  instant.</p>
<p>“My  greatest  injury  is  my  spine,  if  I  exert  it  even  a  little,  my  spine  will   break.”</p>
<p>After  Yang  Feng  explained  his  situation,  he  joined  Zhao  Lian  Yun  and  Old   Lord  Can  Yang’s  group.</p>
<p>The  three  of  them  continued  to  search,  soon,  they  found  Vicious  Lightning   Fiend.</p>
<p>Vicious  Lightning  Fiend  also  had  rank  seven  cultivation  level,  his  body  was   covered  in  lightning  as  he  floated  in  the  air,  three  Lightning  Deities   surrounded  his  body  and  assisted  in  healing  him.</p>
<p>While  healing,  lightning  crackled  around  him  as  sparks  were  created,   causing  quite  a  commotion.</p>
<p>“I  was  fortunate.”</p>
<p>“Right  before  the  explosion  occurred,  I  watched  while  having  my  Lightning   Deities  revolve  around  me  to  leave  a  good  impression  on  Lord  Primordial   Origin  Immortal  Venerable.”</p>
<p>After  the  explosion,  although  there  were  more  than  ten  Lightning  Deities   earlier,  only  four  remained.  To  save  his  life,  Vicious  Lightning  Fiend   sacrificed  another  Lightning  Deity  to  heal  himself.  Now,  only  three  were   left.</p>
<p>This  was  a  huge  loss  for  him.</p>
<p>“The  killer  move  Lightning  Deity  was  created  by  Vicious  Lightning  Fiend   using  the  incomplete  Immortal  Gu  recipe  of  Blood  Deity.  When  the  qi  tides   swept  the  world  and  the  five  regions  became  one,  immortal  materials   appeared,  which  allowed  Vicious  Lightning  Fiend  to  receive  a  lot  of   funding  from  Myriad  Dragon  Dock,  he  quickly  accumulated  many   Lightning  Deities.  With  more  than  ten  Lightning  Deities  which  had  rank   seven  Gu  Immortal  battle  strength  each,  he  was  known  as  a  top  expert   among  rank  seven  Gu  Immortals  in  Central  Continent,  only  being  inferior   to  Shi  Lei.”</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  recalled  as  she  greeted  Vicious  Lightning  Fiend.</p>
<p>Vicious  Lightning  Fiend’s  bad  temper  was  famous,  but  now,  he  was  very   polite  to  Zhao  Lian  Yun.</p>
<p>Seeing  that  her  injuries  were  the  lightest,  he  acknowledged  her  strength.</p>
<p>This  explosion  killed  most  of  Central  Continent’s  Gu  Immortals,  the   remaining  ones  were  either  lucky  or  sufficiently  strong!</p>
<p>But  there  was  an  awkward  thing.</p>
<p>Gu  Immortals  with  greater  battle  strength  often  did  not  excel  in  healing.   They  were  adept  at  healing  themselves  but  not  others.</p>
<p>Thus,  even  though  Vicious  Lightning  Fiend  joined  this  group,  they  still  had   no  way  to  help  Bu  Zhen  Zi  or  Shi  Lei.</p>
<p>As  time  passed,  the  white  qi  fog  that  obscured  everyone’s  vision  became   less  dense.</p>
<p>These  white  qi  were  qi  path  immortal  materials,  but  nobody  had  the  mood   to  collect  them.</p>
<p>The  blessed  lands  or  even  grotto-heavens  left  behind  by  the  Central   Continent  Gu  Immortals  who  died  were  absorbing  a  large  amount  of  white   qi.  At  the  same  time,  white  qi  also  flowed  out  of  Heavenly  Court  through   the  gaps  that  formed.</p>
<p>In  any  case,  the  vision  of  the  immortals  was  returning.</p>
<p>“Wait.”  Yang  Feng,  who  had  turned  into  a  giant  wolf  and  needed  to  rest   every  few  steps,  suddenly  spoke.</p>
<p>Everyone  was  used  to  it.</p>
<p>Along  the  way,  he  had  been  asking  for  them  to  stop  once  in  a  while  to  lie   down  and  recover  his  strength.</p>
<p>His  waist  injury  was  too  severe,  the  wound  was  huge  as  well,  one  could  see   his  kidney  from  the  exposed  wound.</p>
<p>White  qi  was  flowing  out  of  his  kidney.</p>
<p>“Yang  Feng,  is  your  waist  hurting  again?”  Zhao  Lian  Yun  cast  a  concerned   gaze  at  him.</p>
<p>Yang  Feng  nodded:  ”Of  course  my  waist  hurts,  but  more  importantly,  there   are  people  coming  from  behind  us.”</p>
<p>“Indeed,  there  are  three  of  them.”  Old  Lord  Can  Yang’s  gaze  flickered  as  he   noticed.</p>
<p>“Cough,  cough.”  After  saying  that,  he  started  coughing  blood  again.</p>
<p>“Our  allies?”  Vicious  Lightning  Fiend  asked  while  mobilizing  his  thoughts,   the  three  Lightning  Deities  quickly  spread  out  towards  the  sky  behind  them.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  and  the  rest  stopped  moving,  they  started  at  the  stirring   white  qi.</p>
<p>The  three  Lightning  Deities  waited  solemnly,  but  suddenly,  one  spun  around   on  the  spot,  one  flew  up  into  the  sky,  while  the  final  one  twisted  its  body   around  like  it  was  having  a  spasm  from  a  lightning  shock!</p>
