        <p>: Where There’s Life, There’s Hope</p>
<p>Sitting on a deserted mound, Fang Di Chang was still as a rock.</p>
<p>Ever since the two heavens merged, there was no longer day or night, in place of that was a mix of black and white in the sky.</p>
<p>Thus, different areas had different intensity of brightness.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang was currently in the darkness, he looked at the empty mound expressionlessly, it was a barren desert with no vegetation in sight.</p>
<p>But because of the fusion of two heavens, this huge desert was split into two areas, one was bright while the other was dark.</p>
<p>This was tassel desert, a super resource point of Fang clan.</p>
<p>Every year, at a certain period, earth roots would grow here like grass or willow branches, they were soft but durable.</p>
<p>The earth roots were long or short, they ranged from mortal materials to rank eight immortal materials.</p>
<p>At peak growth, the earth roots would cover the entire tassel desert, when wind blew, looking from above, it would seem like a huge sea made of earth roots, the waves would look grand and impressive.</p>
<p>This was Fang clan’s number one resource point, it was the pride of all Fang clan Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>But now, it was being sold to Fang Yuan.</p>
<p>Once this transaction was done, it would never be returned, this was farewell.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang had a plain expression but his heart was like this desert, it was barren and cold.</p>
<p>Fang Gong flew over from afar, he landed on the barren mound and stood beside Fang Di Chang.</p>
<p>“I knew you were here.” Fang Gong sighed.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang, who was seated, suddenly had a twisted expression as he clenched his fists: “Fang Yuan did this on purpose!”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid he has known about Wan Gu Chou all along, but he did not say it and caused our clan to suffer a huge loss!”</p>
<p>Fang Gong was stunned.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang continued: “Even if he did not know about Wan Gu Chou, he concealed the secret that he could revive our clan’s Gu Immortals! As long as he mentioned it, even if he vaguely hinted it, I would have known.”</p>
<p>“If I had known that venerables are able to easily revive Gu Immortals, I would be on guard against a threat like Wan Gu Chou!”</p>
<p>“In fact, we might have exchanged for that forgotten sorrow Immortal Gu earlier, if we could defend against Wan Gu Chou’s killer move, we would not have lost, the alliance against Wan clan would have succeeded!”</p>
<p>Towards the end, Fang Di Chang was basically screaming his lungs out.</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>Back then, the situation was hanging on a thread.</p>
<p>The battle between Fang clan and the alliance against Fang clan was very close.</p>
<p>If they knew about Wan Gu Chou, Fang clan would not have sent all six Immortal Gu Houses to attack Myriad Age Building, Wan Gu Chou’s killer move had a limited range after all.</p>
<p>But at that time, Fang clan did not know about this information, so they pressured Wan clan’s members to try to obtain the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Fang Gong smiled bitterly: “Since it has already happened, second supreme elder, no need to ponder upon it. We do not have Spring Autumn Cicada to return to the past.”</p>
<p>“Earlier, when Heavenly Court revived Gu Immortals, they were all their members. Everyone guessed that their revival had something to do with their contributed immortal apertures. Furthermore, because Fang Yuan nearly destroyed the entire immortal graveyard, it is very hard to deduce Wan Gu Chou’s revival.”</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang had a cold expression: “No, it is Fang Yuan, everything is caused by Fang Yuan. He is the greatest mastermind behind everything.”</p>
<p>“I have woken up now!”</p>
<p>“Our Fang clan wanted to destroy the anti-Fang alliance, it was not something Heavenly Court wanted to see, but Fang Yuan did not like that either.”</p>
<p>“If our Fang clan obtains victory, we will no longer attack the other super forces.”</p>
<p>“And in this current situation, we need to urgently move and sell our resource points to Fang Yuan in exchange for Immortal Gu and also to revive Gu Immortals.”</p>
<p>“Now, what will we do?”</p>
<p>“Without resource points and the ability to provide for ourselves, we can only rely on Fang Yuan increasingly!”</p>
<p>“We can only invade other super forces’ resource points and exchange them to Fang Yuan for Immortal Gu and other cultivation resources.”</p>
<p>“Our Fang clan has become his vanguard, we are his bandits to loot Western Desert.”</p>
<p>“And this Gu Yue Fang Yuan is still staying in Eastern Sea, he is the high and mighty Great Love Immortal Venerable!”</p>
<p>“He will declare to everyone that he is not interfering in Western Desert’s affairs. All of the vile reputation will be shouldered by my Fang clan alone. He, Gu Yue Fang Yuan, has a clean reputation!”</p>
<p>“Hehehe… hahaha…”</p>
<p>“What Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance? What Great Love Immortal Venerable?”</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang raised his head up and laughed in a pitiful tone of mockery.</p>
<p>His eyes were reddened, his hair was messy, the light of tears flickered in his eyes.</p>
<p>“First supreme elder Fang Gong, think about it, don’t you feel that Wan clan’s first supreme elder died too peculiarly?”</p>
<p>“With his death, our Fang clan only has one route to take.”</p>
<p>“This is Fang Yuan, he is covered in a false human skin, but he is a vile beast that devours everyone with no hesitation.”</p>
<p>“I hate him, I am truly hateful.”</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“I hate that my Fang clan got too involved with Fang Yuan.”</p>
<p>“I hate those Eastern Sea super forces who are too weak and meek, they let Fang Yuan rule over them so easily!”</p>
<p>“However, the one I hate most is myself!”</p>
<p>“To think that I am a wisdom path Gu Immortal, not only did I fail to expose Fang Yuan’s schemes, I caused our entire clan to become his pawns!”</p>
<p>“We were manipulated and toyed around by him!”</p>
<p>“I am the greatest sinner of Fang clan…”</p>
<p>Saying so, Fang Di Chang knelt on the ground, his head was lowered to the ground as he punched the soil below him and cried out loud.</p>
<p>This proud wisdom path Gu Immortal had not lost his composure for over a hundred years, he was crying so pitifully now.</p>
<p>Fang Gong sighed as he sat down beside Fang Di Chang.</p>
<p>“How could I have not been suspicious about the peculiar death of Wan clan’s first supreme elder?”</p>
<p>“But even if this is Fang Yuan’s scheme, what can we do?”</p>
<p>“Do we have evidence?”</p>
<p>“Hehe.” Fang Gong smiled in a weak and powerless way: “Even if we have evidence, what can we do to Heaven Refining Demon Venerable?”</p>
<p>Fang Gong placed his arm on Fang Di Chang’s shoulder: “Don’t lose your cool, second supreme elder, you are the strategist of Fang clan. If the other Fang clan Gu Immortals see this, what will they think? What will happen to Fang clan’s morale?”</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang gritted his teeth and stopped crying.</p>
<p>He sat upright and moved shoulder to shoulder with Fang Gong.</p>
<p>Fang Gong continued to speak: “I feel hatred too, I hate Heavenly Court, I hate Wan clan, I hate Fang Yuan, and I hate you. But similarly, I hate myself the most!”</p>
<p>“As the first supreme elder of Fang clan, I actually lost to Wan Gu Chou’s killer move. I am like a dog that ran away pitifully, I cannot do anything.”</p>
<p>“My fist is so weak, my body is as fragile as glass.”</p>
<p>“Fang Di Chang, you are not the first supreme elder, I am!”</p>
<p>“Who is to blame for Fang clan’s current situation?”</p>
<p>“Nobody has committed a greater mistake than me!”</p>
<p>“If death can atone for my sins, I will immediately suicide in front of the anti-Fang alliance. But that will not happen! We know the truth behind the righteous path, if Fang clan loses the only rank eight like me, those people will be even more ruthless.”</p>
<p>“I need to live, I need to raise my fist and show a firm expression, I need to live with my chest held high!”</p>
<p>“That is how I can help Fang clan, I want to make compensation for my sins.”</p>
<p>“I want to atone for my sins through actions!”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be the greatest sinner of our clan, I don’t want our clan to end because of my leadership!”</p>
<p>“Do you understand this? Fang Di Chang!”</p>
<p>Fang Gong screamed.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang gritted his teeth, he started at Fang Gong: “Of course I understand!!”</p>
<p>Fang Gong stood up and looked at tassel desert as well as the sky, he said: “Today’s tassel desert is like the moving rock crevice of back then. We must learn from the first generation Fang clan immortal ancestor and face our difficulties head on.”</p>
<p>“What is our homeland?”</p>
<p>“It is not these resource points, but ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Where there’s life, there’s hope.”</p>
<p>“You are right.” Fang Di Chang also stood up as he showed a determined expression: “Our Fang clan still has hope!”</p>
<p>Immemorial two heavens.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s huge mountain-like body charged towards two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals, Jun Shen Guang and Che Wei.</p>
<p>As qi tides blew, a formless pressure enveloped Jun Shen Guang and Che Wei.</p>
<p>“Oh no, why did he come to us?” Jun Shen Guang frowned tightly.</p>
<p>Che Wei sighed: “Even if Spectral Soul Demon Venerable is not sane now, we are not his match. Retreat!”</p>
<p>“But these stars were lured here after so much hard work, and this heavenly veil was given to us by Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.” Jun Shen Guang gritted his teeth, in the end, he also chose to retreat.</p>
<p>The three headed thousand armed Spectral Soul Demon Venerable growled and raised hundreds of thick black arms that were the size of ancient trees, he slashed at the space before him.</p>
<p>With continuous cracking sounds, the empty space in the sky was torn apart, as if a huge veil was shredded into pieces.</p>
<p>And within the veil, there were countless huge stars.</p>
<p>Bam bam bam…</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable charged into the field of stars, along the way, all of the stars that touched his huge body were destroyed, he even used his arms to crush many of the stars he saw.</p>
<p>The two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals saw that their hard work was being destroyed, they felt extremely angry.</p>
<p>But thankfully, stars scattered and flew away, the senseless Spectral Soul Demon Venerable only managed to destroy a small portion of them.</p>
<p>Che Wei and Jun Shen Guang discussed among themselves, they decided to keep the heavenly veil and bring all of the remaining stars to Central Continent.</p>
<p>After all, this was a mission handed out by Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.</p>
<p>“This is a heavenly veil?” Shen Shang suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>Che Wei’s and Jun Shen Guang’s expressions sank at once, they became very alert. Shen Shang displayed pseudo venerable battle strength in Crazed Demon Cave, he was a huge enemy to these two.</p>
<p>Shen Shang also collected some of the heavenly veil, he looked at Spectral Soul Demon Venerable who was causing destruction to the stars and smiled at the two Heavenly Court immortals: “Can you tell me what Heavenly Court is collecting these stars for?”</p>
<p>Che Wei’s and Jun Shen Guang’s expressions became grim.</p>
<p>Shen Shang continued: “So be it if you don’t tell me. Since you are using the heavenly veil to collect the stars, you must be trying to act secretly, you don’t want to be disturbed.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I will take the heavenly veil and expose your actions to the public.”</p>
<p>Che Wei snorted coldly: “Shen Shang, don’t go overboard. Fang clan’s outcome is also the outcome of all those super forces who joined Fang Yuan! Your Shen clan’s good days are coming to an end.”</p>
<p>Shen Shang squinted: “I won’t trouble you with my Shen clan’s affairs. But what I do know is that your good times are ending now!”</p>
<p>“Retreat!” Jun Shen Guang spoke while Che Wei acknowledged the decision.</p>
<p>Shen Shang chased and forced these Heavenly Court immortals to retreat before he returned and stored the collected heavenly veil.</p>
<p>“The heavenly veil is an extremely precious heaven path immortal material, it is best if I contribute this to Alliance Leader Fang Yuan!”</p>
