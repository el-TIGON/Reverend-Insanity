        <p>:  Heavenly  Court’s  Resolve</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  and  the  others  quickly  cast  a  look  of  surprise  at  Vicious   Lightning  Fiend.</p>
<p>Vicious  Lightning  Fiend’s  face  turned  red,  this  was  a  rarely  seen  expression,   he  explained:  ”The  Lightning  Deities  are  damaged  from  the  explosion,  due   to  the  qi  path  dao  marks  carved  on  them,  they  are  hard  to  control.  If  my   concentration  falls,  they  will  go  berserk.”</p>
<p>Everyone  gasped  in  realization.</p>
<p>They  were  slightly  anxious  earlier  as  they  thought  the  Lightning  Deities   were  being  attacked  by  a  mysterious  method.</p>
<p>A  few  breaths  of  time  later,  Old  Lord  Can  Yang  relaxed  and  said:  ”They  are   our  comrades.”</p>
<p>Soon,  two  rank  eight  Gu  Immortals  appeared  before  the  group.</p>
<p>They  were  rank  eight  supreme  elders  from  Heaven’s  Envy  Manor  and  Spirit   Butterfly  Valley.</p>
<p>The  immortals  saw  them  and  became  joyous.</p>
<p>These  were  rank  eight  Gu  Immortals  after  all,  the  supreme  elders  had   countless  methods  in  their  possession,  they  managed  to  stabilize  Yang  Feng   and  Old  Lord  Can  Yang’s  injuries,  but  the  effect  was  not  great.</p>
<p>While  the  group  of  immortals  discussed  how  they  would  continue  saving   others,  white  qi  surged  and  moved  like  it  was  pushed  aside  by  a  huge  blood- red  beast.</p>
<p>Soon  after,  the  vague  figure  of  blood  appeared  from  within  the  white  qi,  it   was  the  rank  eight  Immortal  Gu  House  —  Demon  Judgment  Board!</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  was  controlling  it  from  within,  after  seeing  the   immortals,  he  stopped.</p>
<p>Rays  of  blood-red  light  shot  out  of  Demon  Judgment  Board  and  landed  on   everyone.</p>
<p>They  did  not  resist  and  let  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  heal  them.</p>
<p>Their  injuries  healed  to  an  extent,  but  heavy  injuries  could  not  become   small  injuries.</p>
<p>Although  Demon  Judgment  Board  was  a  rank  eight  Immortal  Gu  House,  it   specialized  in  investigation,  its  combat  prowess  and  healing  ability  were  far   weaker.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  thought  about  it  and  said  to  the  ten  children  of  human   path  inside  the  Immortal  Gu  House:  ”The  situation  is  dire,  friends,  may  I   ask  you  to  go  around  to  help  heal  the  rest?”</p>
<p>“Lord  Fang  Zheng,  please  don’t  say  that,  the  ten  great  ancient  sects  are  all   subsidiaries  of  Heavenly  Court,  we  are  all  of  the  same  faction.  We  will  do   our  best  to  help  the  rest!”  The  ten  children  of  human  path  quickly   responded.</p>
<p>They  were  lucky  to  have  avoided  the  explosion  as  they  had  entered  Divine   Emperor  City  earlier.</p>
<p>Divine  Emperor  City  was  damaged  by  Shen  Shang  and  Lu  Wei  Yin  earlier,   afterwards,  it  flew  into  Heavenly  Court  along  with  Fei  He  Mountain  and   others.</p>
<p>There  was  no  helping  it,  if  it  remained  in  Central  Continent,  Fang  Yuan’s   main  body  would  destroy  it.</p>
<p>Genesis  Lotus’  will  controlled  Divine  Emperor  City,  he  was  confident  in   blocking  Shen  Shang  and  Lu  Wei  Yin,  but  against  Fang  Yuan’s  main  body,   the  outcome  would  be  different.</p>
<p>Divine  Emperor  City  was  the  sacred  land  of  human  path,  it  had  a  large   number  of  mortals  and  Gu  Masters.  The  painting  worlds  were  the  best   places  to  develop  human  path,  during  this  period  of  time,  there  were  many   new  results.</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  were  all  rank  six  human  path  Gu  Immortals   now,  they  were  ordered  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  enter   the  painting  worlds  of  Divine  Emperor  City  and  cultivate.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  was  also  deployed  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  to  enter  Divine  Emperor  City.  He  was  not  there  to  comprehend   human  path,  he  interacted  with  Genesis  Lotus’  will  to  learn  painting  path   instead.</p>
<p>Earlier,  Fang  Zheng  had  entered  the  derivation  formation  and   comprehended  the  essence  of  painting  path,  he  could  use  the  style  of   painting  path  to  unleash  various  blood  path  killer  moves  through  Demon   Judgment  Board,  causing  his  strength  to  rise  greatly.  This  caused  Gu  Yue   Fang  Zheng’s  interest  in  painting  path  to  increase  greatly,  because  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  noticed  his  talent  and  prospect  in  painting   path,  she  did  not  stint  on  nurturing  him.</p>
<p>Although  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  was  from  Southern  Border,  due  to  Fang   Yuan,  he  was  nurtured  by  various  leaders  of  Heavenly  Court  like  Qin  Ding   Ling  and  even  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.  Thus,  his  cultivation   level  had  been  rising  explosively  the  entire  time.</p>
<p>The  ten  children  of  human  path  felt  admiration  and  closeness  to  Fang   Zheng.</p>
<p>Fang  Zheng’s  strength  was  greater  than  them,  he  was  also  the  current   generation  Demon  Judgment  Board  Lord.  Although  he  only  had  rank  seven   cultivation  level,  he  was  already  a  member  of  Heavenly  Court  and  had  won   many  battles.  With  his  status  and  identity,  the  ten  children  of  human  path   who  wanted  to  join  Heavenly  Court  admired  him.</p>
<p>As  for  closeness,  Fang  Zheng’s  age  meant  that  he  and  the  ten  children  of   human  path  were  of  the  same  generation.</p>
<p>Thus,  after  Fang  Zheng  made  the  arrangements,  the  ten  children  of  human   path  accepted  the  task  and  flew  out  of  Demon  Judgment  Board  to  help  Zhao   Lian  Yun  and  the  rest.</p>
<p>“It  was  really  fortunate  that  you  juniors  with  only  rank  six  cultivation  level   stayed  in  Divine  Emperor  City  and  managed  to  survive.”</p>
<p>“Oh?  So  this  is  a  human  path  method.”</p>
<p>“It  is  truly…  profound  beyond  words!”</p>
<p>“No  wonder  Heavenly  Court  is  putting  all  its  effort  into  developing  human   path,  it  truly  has  unlimited  potential.”</p>
<p>Old  Lord  Can  Yang  and  the  rest  knew  who  the  ten  children  of  human  path   were.  Initially,  they  still  put  up  airs  and  acted  like  seniors,  but  soon,  their   expressions  and  attitude  changed  as  they  started  to  praise  in  amazement.</p>
<p>Human  path  was  very  unique,  the  healing  methods  of  the  ten  children  of   human  path  were  human  path  methods,  but  they  were  still  effective  on  Zhao   Lian  Yun  and  the  others.</p>
<p>Their  injuries  were  originally  quite  severe  and  had  only  been  suppressed,   even  with  the  help  of  two  rank  eight  Gu  Immortals  and  Demon  Judgment   Board’s  healing,  they  did  not  recover  by  a  large  extent.</p>
<p>But  now,  with  the  human  path  killer  moves,  their  conditions  improved   rapidly  with  immediate  effect.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  nodded  as  he  saw  that  the  immortals  were  recovering   with  the  help  of  the  ten  children  of  human  path,  he  quickly  went  to  the  inner   area  using  Demon  Judgment  Board.</p>
<p>Along  the  way,  he  saw  many  immortal  aperture  entrances,  Fang  Zheng’s   expression  was  solemn  as  his  heart  sank,  he  felt  worried:  ”Most  of  the  Gu   Immortals  in  Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects  are  dead,  but  the   immortal  graveyard  is  almost  completely  expended,  how  are  we  going  to   revive  them?”</p>
<p>“Recalling  the  situation,  the  qi  harvest  fruit  exploded  too  suddenly,  there   must  be  a  huge  scheme  behind  it.”</p>
<p>“I  wonder  what  happened  to  the  Heavenly  Court  seniors?”</p>
<p>“The  most  important  person  is  still  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable.  Her  current  condition  will  determine  the  future  of  Heavenly   Court  and  the  whole  of  humanity!”</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  had  undergone  many  ordeals,  his  foresight  was   sharpened  and  he  had  a  clear  understanding  of  the  situation.</p>
<p>The  inner  area  had  much  denser  white  qi  than  the  outside.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  was  very  anxious,  under  his  control,  Demon  Judgment   Board  moved  even  faster  by  thirty  percent  now.</p>
<p>Soon,  he  saw  the  immortals  of  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Fang  Zheng’s  eyebrows  first  eased  before  frowning  again.</p>
<p>He  found  that  many  of  Heavenly  Court’s  Gu  Immortals  were  around,  but   some  were  missing,  it  was  unknown  if  they  had  died.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  Gu  Immortals  were  strong  after  all,  ten  people  had   already  gathered  here.</p>
<p>They  were  standing  around  Qin  Ding  Ling.</p>
<p>Fang  Zheng  quickly  left  Demon  Judgment  Board  and  greeted  the   immortals.</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  nodded  at  him  before  looking  around  and  starting  to  hand   out  instructions.</p>
<p>She  had  a  haggard  expression,  there  was  still  bloodstains  on  her  lips,  but   when  she  spoke  now,  there  was  a  hint  of  authority.</p>
<p>The  white  qi  fog  obscured  everyone’s  vision  and  investigative  methods,   with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  missing  now,  Qin  Ding  Ling   had  no  choice  but  to  take  the  role  of  leader.</p>
<p>After  the  immortals  discussed  this,  she  split  them  into  three  groups.</p>
<p>One  group  was  led  by  Ruan  Dan,  they  searched  for  surviving  Gu  Immortals   while  collecting  information  to  collate  data  of  Heavenly  Court’s  losses.</p>
<p>One  group  was  led  by  Duke  Mei,  they  ventured  into  the  center  of  the  white   qi  zone  to  search  for  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>The  final  group  was  led  by  her,  there  were  Che  Wei,  Wan  Zi  Hong,  Red   Heart  Traveler,  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy,  and  other  Heavenly  Court  Gu   Immortals  with  outstanding  battle  strength.  Because  Fang  Zheng  had   Demon  Judgment  Board,  he  was  in  this  group  as  well.</p>
<p>Their  group  would  leave  Heavenly  Court  and  guard  the  vicinity  to  defend   against  any  possible  attacking  foes!</p>
<p>“Master.”  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  brought  Red  Heart  Traveler  into  Demon   Judgment  Board  and  said  respectfully:  ”Let  me  heal  your  injuries!”</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  nodded  and  sat  down,  floating  in  the  air.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  utilized  Demon  Judgment  Board  to  fly  out  of  Heavenly   Court  while  using  its  methods  to  heal  Red  Heart  Traveler.</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  was  originally  pale  as  paper,  but  with  the  help  of  Gu   Yue  Fang  Zheng,  he  quickly  recovered,  his  aura  stabilized.</p>
<p>He  was  a  blood  path  Gu  Immortal,  the  former  Demon  Judgment  Board   Lord,  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  also  cultivated  blood  path,  their  dao  marks  did   not  conflict  so  the  healing  effect  was  outstanding.</p>
<p>While  Red  Heart  Traveler  was  healing,  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  informed  him   of  everything  that  he  saw.</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  nodded  with  a  solemn  expression:  ”Heavenly  Court   suffered  huge  losses,  there  are  gaps  everywhere  now,  even  during  the  fate   war,  there  had  not  been  such  a  severe  damage.”</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  asked  the  question  that  he  wanted  to  know  about:   ”Master,  was  this  explosion  an  accident  or…  the  scheme  of  someone?”</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  shook  his  head:  ”I  can’t  say  for  sure.  Primordial  Origin   Immortal  Venerable’s  revival  methods  have  already  existed  for  over  three   million  years,  it  may  not  have  an  issue  but  Heavenly  Court  went  through   countless  battles,  these  methods  are  no  longer  complete.  Furthermore,  the   five  regions  unified  and  the  world  went  through  huge  changes…”</p>
<p>“But  if  someone  did  this,  then  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Heaven   Refining  Demon  Venerable  are  the  most  suspicious.  Between  them,  Heaven   Refining  Demon  Venerable  is  the  most  likely  culprit!”</p>
<p>Saying  so,  Red  Heart  Traveler  looked  at  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng.</p>
<p>Fang  Zheng  gritted  his  teeth  but  did  not  speak.</p>
<p>Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  was  his  brother.</p>
<p>“Regardless  of  whether  this  is  a  scheme  or  not,  we  are  going  to  have  an   intense  battle  now!  Fang  Zheng,  you  need  to  prepare  yourself.”  Red  Heart   Traveler  did  not  continue  the  topic,  he  started  to  inform  Fang  Zheng  with   concern.</p>
<p>Fang  Zheng  nodded  as  his  expression  turned  stern.  Now  that  Heavenly   Court  had  such  huge  damage,  it  was  likely  that  Heaven  Refining  Demon</p>
<p>Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  would  attack,  they  would  not   let  this  chance  slip  by.</p>
<p>One  could  say  that  Heavenly  Court  was  in  immense  danger  now.</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  told  him  to  prepare  himself,  Fang  Zheng  knew  that  it   meant  the  preparation  to  sacrifice  his  life!</p>
<p>Regarding  this,  Fang  Zheng  was  resolved.</p>
<p>Not  only  him,  the  other  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  also  had  the  same   resolve.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  Demon  Judgment  Board  shook  as  red  lights  shone,  it  was  an   alert.</p>
<p>Red  Heart  and  Fang  Zheng’s  expressions  changed.</p>
<p>Demon  Judgment  Board  excelled  in  investigation,  it  was  the  first  to  obtain   the  new  information.</p>
<p>A  series  of  totems  flew  around  and  provoked  a  huge  mountain-like  monster   to  approach  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>“The  enemy  appeared!”  Fang  Zheng  shouted:  ”It’s  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable!”</p>
<p>Soon,  the  other  Gu  Immortals  also  noticed  this,  Qin  Ding  Ling  and  others   gathered.</p>
<p>“Damn  it,  Fang  Yuan  did  this!”</p>
<p>“This  shameless  and  unscrupulous  person!!”</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  completely  insane,  but  the  totem  killer   moves  were  Fang  Yuan’s  signature  method.  The  situation  was  very  clear,</p>
<p>the  Heavenly  Court  immortals  looked  with  bloodshot  eyes,  they  were   extremely  furious.</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  contacted  Duke  Mei,  but  as  the  white  qi  was  too  thick,   communication  was  tough.</p>
<p>The  center  of  the  huge  explosion  was  filled  with  qi  path  dao  marks,  Duke   Mei  and  the  rest  moved  with  difficulty,  but  they  did  not  find  any  trace  of   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  had  a  cold  expression  but  her  stable  tone  had  a  sense  of   patriotism:  ”Although  spectral  heaven  is  huge,  Heavenly  Court  is  right   behind  us,  we  cannot  retreat!  Everyone,  we  must  use  all  our  effort  to   destroy  the  totems  and  lure  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  away!”</p>
<p>Before  she  finished  her  words,  she  charged  forward  without  any  regard  for   her  life!</p>
<p>There  was  no  shouting  or  screaming,  Wan  Zi  Hong,  Che  Wei,  and  Demon   Judgment  Board  followed  after  her.</p>
<p>Bam  bam  bam…</p>
<p>A  huge  battle  soon  erupted,  it  got  intense  immediately.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  gave  it  their  all,  they  were  injured  to   begin  with,  this  battle  caused  their  injuries  to  become  more  severe  as  blood   spewed  everywhere.</p>
<p>The  totems  were  destroyed  by  them.</p>
<p>The  results  were  outstanding!</p>
<p>However,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  sensed  the  aura  of  Heavenly   Court  and  roared  loudly  as  he  took  the  initiative  to  attack  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  and  the  rest  resisted  with  all  their  might  but  they  were   completely  helpless  against  the  advancement  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>At  once,  the  Heavenly  Court  immortals  fell  into  despair.</p>
<p>Author’s  Note:  For  the  following  battle,  there  will  be  many  characters   involved,  it  will  be  more  exciting  after  including  them.  The  interaction  of   these  characters  will  make  the  Gu  world  more  vibrant  and  lively.  Fang   Yuan’s  following  actions  will  also  create  huge  fatal  danger  for  them,  they   will  experience  great  unforgettable  changes  in  their  lives.</p>
