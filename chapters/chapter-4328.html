        <p>:  Finding  Self  Gu</p>
<p>“Quick,  cultivate  this!”  Within  Tan  Ku’s  immortal  aperture,  a  middle  aged   rank  five  Gu  Master  was  handing  out  a  cultivation  method  to  Wang  Xiao  Er.</p>
<p>“Foster  father,  what  is  this?”  Wang  Xiao  Er  asked  in  confusion.</p>
<p>Wang  Xiao  Er  had  his  own  secret.</p>
<p>He  was  not  of  Fang  clan’s  bloodline,  he  was  a  captive  of  Fang  Dong  Xi.  But   after  Fang  Dong  Xi  died  in  battle,  his  immortal  aperture  was  invaded  by   Xiao  Ye  Hu,  causing  a  huge  commotion.</p>
<p>Using  the  opportunity,  Wang  Xiao  Er  escaped  for  his  life  and  mixed  in  with   this  branch  of  Fang  Dong  Xi’s  descendants.</p>
<p>Afterwards,  they  were  sold  in  treasure  yellow  heaven.</p>
<p>Tan  Ku  was  one  of  the  Gu  Immortals  who  bought  these  human  slaves,   within  the  batch  of  Fang  clansmen  that  he  bought,  there  was  Wang  Xiao  Er.</p>
<p>Thus,  Wang  Xiao  Er  started  his  new  life  in  Tan  Ku’s  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Naturally,  Tan  Ku’s  immortal  aperture  had  Tan  clan’s  bloodline.  Thus,  the   Fang  clansmen  all  had  low  status,  they  were  slaves.</p>
<p>But  even  among  slaves,  there  was  a  difference  in  status.</p>
<p>For  example,  the  middle  aged  Gu  Master  in  front  of  Wang  Xiao  Er.</p>
<p>He  had  a  rather  pitiful  life,  when  Fang  Dong  Xi’s  immortal  aperture  was  in   a  commotion,  his  whole  family  died.  The  middle  aged  Gu  Master  became   disheartened  and  did  not  want  to  marry  anyone  else.  After  seeing  the  lonely   Wang  Xiao  Er  who  was  in  the  same  plight  as  him,  he  felt  that  this  young   man  resembled  his  son  and  took  him  in  as  a  foster  son.</p>
<p>After  all,  in  the  eyes  of  the  middle  aged  Gu  Master,  Wang  Xiao  Er  was  also   a  Fang  clan  descendant.</p>
<p>The  middle  aged  Gu  Master  knocked  Wang  Xiao  Er’s  head  and  laughed  as   he  scolded:  ”What  are  you  suspicious  about?  Do  you  think  I’ll  harm  you?”</p>
<p>“I’ll  tell  you  the  truth,  the  Gu  Immortals  who  bought  us  are  from  Central   Continent.”</p>
<p>“He  bought  us  because  he  took  an  interest  in  our  aptitude.”</p>
<p>“Now,  he  has  handed  down  a  human  path  cultivation  method.  If  we  can   cultivate  it  successfully,  we  will  be  able  to  raise  our  status.  In  the  future,  we   may  even  become  Gu  Immortals.”</p>
<p>Wang  Xiao  Er  listened  in  a  dumbfound  manner.</p>
<p>But  soon,  he  stated  his  suspicions:  ”If  this  is  such  a  precious  cultivation   method,  why  is  the  Central  Continent  Gu  Immortal  not  cultivating  it   himself?  Why  isn’t  he  leaving  it  for  his  own  descendants  but  us  instead?”</p>
<p>The  middle  aged  Gu  Master  clearly  knew  many  Gu  Immortal  secrets,  he   had  a  broad  vision.  He  explained:  ”Gu  Immortals  cultivate  their  own  path,   with  human  path  being  one  of  the  possibilities.  Since  this  Gu  Immortal  has   already  become  immortal,  he  cannot  cultivate  human  path  anymore.”</p>
<p>“Furthermore,  not  everyone  has  the  aptitude  to  become  an  immortal.”</p>
<p>“Human  path  has  just  started  developing,  Central  Continent’s  Gu  Immortals   are  handing  out  these  methods  as  a  trial.  Thus,  for  his  own  genius   descendants,  he  will  definitely  leave  a  portion  of  the  essence  of  his  own</p>
<p>cultivation  method  for  them.  The  remaining  Tan  clansmen  and  us  will   cultivate  human  path.”</p>
<p>“Human  path  is  really  underdeveloped,  in  our  former  blessed  land,  I’ve   never  even  heard  of  it!  But  we  have  no  choice  now,  if  we  don’t  cultivate,   we  won’t  even  have  any  opportunity!”</p>
<p>“Xiao  Er,  you  will  live  your  life  in  here,  those  Tan  clansmen  will  step  on   you  and  command  you  like  a  slave.  Are  you  willing  to  live  like  this?”</p>
<p>Wang  Xiao  Er  quickly  shook  his  head  and  said  solemn:  ”Foster  father,   please  teach  me  the  method,  I  will  cultivate!”</p>
<p>Wang  Xiao  Er  obtained  a  large  amount  of  human  path  information,  it  was   helpful  in  raising  his  understanding  of  human  path.  There  were  also  several   human  path  Gu  worms,  they  were  the  foundation  for  starting  his  human   path  cultivation.</p>
<p>After  the  middle  aged  Gu  Master  taught  Wang  Xiao  Er  some  lessons,  the   latter  started  to  cultivate  on  his  own.</p>
<p>On  this  night,  Wang  Xiao  Er  was  so  excited  he  could  not  sleep,  he  decided   to  cultivate  instead.</p>
<p>But  an  Immortal  Gu  was  accidentally  awakened  by  him  in  this  situation!</p>
<p>The  Immortal  Gu’s  will  took  the  initiative  and  communicated  with  Wang   Xiao  Er  as  he  felt  very  surprised:  ”Self  Gu?!”</p>
<p>Self  Gu  was  so  small  and  had  hidden  itself  within  Wang  Xiao  Er’s  body,   nobody  else  had  sensed  it.</p>
<p>He  remembered  that  this  was  a  famous  legendary  Gu  in  <<The  Legends  of   Ren  Zu>>,  he  became  extremely  happy  and  incredulous.  Thus,  he  quickly   flipped  through  <<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>.</p>
<p><<The  Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>,  chapter  five,  section  thirty-eight  —</p>
<p>After  falling  into  the  water  of  the  River  of  Time,  Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two   woke  up  in  shock.</p>
<p>The  three  immediately  climb  up  to  a  nearby  floating  ice,  although  it  was   only  a  short  time,  they  had  already  grown  old.</p>
<p>“Time  Gu  is  hidden  within  the  River  of  Time,  our  lifespan  will  be  washed   away  by  the  river  water.”  Great  Strength  True  Martial  sighed.</p>
<p>Ren  Zu  felt  regretful:  ”Constantly  encountering  good  situations  is  actually  a   bad  thing,  it  will  create  a  huge  problem!  It  is  not  good  to  be  too  happy  or   constantly  happy,  it  can  make  people  indulge  in  the  present  and  forget  about   time  as  they  get  immersed  entirely.”</p>
<p>But  Carefree  Wisdom  Heart  said  with  a  tone  of  joy:  ”Quick,  look  at  your   heart!”</p>
<p>The  three  of  them  inspected  their  inner  heart,  they  saw  that  many   accumulated  emotions  had  been  washed  away  earlier  when  they  fell  into  the   river.</p>
<p>This  discovery  made  Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  feel  very  happy.</p>
<p>Next,  they  continued  to  travel  on  the  floating  ice.</p>
<p>Whenever  they  encountered  a  bad  situation  and  felt  negative  emotions,  they   would  put  their  heart  into  the  river  water  to  wash  it:  ”These  bad  situations   will  pass  eventually.”</p>
<p>Their  negative  emotions  faded  away  with  time.</p>
<p>Whenever  they  encountered  a  good  situation  and  felt  immersed  in  joy,  they   would  put  their  heart  into  the  river  water  to  wash  it:  ”These  good  situations   will  pass  eventually.”</p>
<p>Their  positive  emotions  also  weakened  over  time,  preventing  them  from   feeling  indulgent.</p>
<p>Cognition  Gu  saw  that  the  three  of  them  were  constantly  washing  their   hearts,  it  could  not  help  but  remind  them:  ”Time  has  never  healed  the   wounds  of  the  heart,  except  that  your  hearts  have  grown  old.  The  worst   thing  is  not  your  body  growing  old  but  your  hearts  aging.  Stop  washing   them.”</p>
<p>Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  heard  these  words  and  quickly  stopped  their   actions.</p>
<p>But  without  washing  the  hearts,  their  speed  fell  again.</p>
<p>“Let  me  help  you.”  At  this  time,  a  Gu  worm  flew  over  and  landed  on  Ren   Zu.</p>
<p>Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  saw  this  Gu  worm  and  became  very  happy.</p>
<p>It  was  familial  emotion  Gu.</p>
<p>With  the  help  of  familial  emotion  Gu,  Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  spread  their   emotions  around,  the  joy  of  one  person  was  split  among  three,  the  sorrow  of   one  person  was  also  split  into  three.</p>
<p>Using  familial  emotion,  Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  consoled  each  other  and   carried  each  other’s  burden,  they  moved  quickly  and  firmly.</p>
<p>But  good  times  did  not  last.</p>
<p>More  and  more  emotions  accumulated  in  their  hearts,  their  hearts  became   tired  and  gradually  got  hurt  after  being  unable  to  sustain  it  any  longer.</p>
<p>Deep  emotions  hurt  the  heart.</p>
<p>The  situation  soon  aggravated,  because  their  hearts  were  severely  injured,   they  could  not  take  in  more  emotions.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  Carefree  Wisdom  Heart  took  out  a  cage  and  held  it  in  her   hand:  ”This  is  the  Mental  Domain  that  I  created,  place  all  your  emotions  in</p>
<p>here.”</p>
<p>Ren  Zu  and  Great  Strength  True  Martial  did  as  she  said.</p>
<p>They  put  their  emotions  into  the  Mental  Domain.</p>
<p>Immediately,  the  truthful  floating  ice  revealed  its  original  appearance  in   front  of  the  three.</p>
<p>They  were  simply  pieces  of  floating  ice,  the  three  felt  a  different  sensation   towards  it  now.</p>
<p>The  emotions  of  people  did  not  concern  others,  only  their  own  mental  state   mattered.</p>
<p>“What  is  this?”  Carefree  Wisdom  Heart  soon  found  a  Gu  worm  in  the   floating  ice.</p>
<p>The  Gu  worm  answered:  ”I  am  calm  Gu.”</p>
<p>The  truth  was  icy  cold,  this  was  the  attitude  that  one  should  have  when   facing  situations.</p>
<p>Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  finally  reached  the  center  of  the  truthful  floating   ice.</p>
<p>But  they  did  not  find  self  Gu.</p>
<p>“So  self  Gu  is  not  here.”  Ren  Zu  was  very  disappointed.</p>
<p>Initially,  people  would  often  think  that  they  were  the  center  of  all  situations,   but  that  was  not  true.</p>
<p>At  the  center  of  the  truthful  floating  ice,  there  was  no  self  Gu,  but  three   other  Gu  instead.</p>
<p>They  were  rules  Gu,  regulation  Gu,  and  practice  Gu.</p>
<p>Rules  and  regulation  Gu  had  been  with  Ren  Zu  for  a  long  time,  after  Ren   Zu’s  heart  was  eaten  by  the  Predicament,  they  thought  that  he  died  and  left   him.</p>
<p>They  came  here  to  create  truthful  floating  ice  along  with  practice  Gu.</p>
<p>All  sorts  of  situations  were  bound  by  the  rules  and  regulation  of  heaven  and   earth.</p>
<p>The  three  Gu  continued  to  create  truthful  floating  ice  like  this,  afterwards,   under  the  effect  of  time  Gu,  these  floating  ice  flowed  away  and  sank.</p>
<p>Rules  and  regulation  Gu  saw  Ren  Zu  and  felt  surprised:  ”Oh  human,  so  you   did  not  die.”</p>
<p>Ren  Zu  quickly  asked  them  on  how  he  could  find  self  Gu.</p>
<p>Rules  and  regulation  Gu  pointed  at  practice  Gu  and  said  in  unison:  ”It  can   help  you!”</p>
<p>Practice  Gu  replied:  ”Oh  human,  you  have  gone  through  too  many   situations.  After  such  a  long  time,  you  have  changed  a  lot.  Self  Gu  is  the   same,  even  if  it  is  right  before  you,  it  will  feel  very  foreign  now,  you  cannot   recognize  it.”</p>
<p>“What  can  I  do?”  Ren  Zu  was  troubled.</p>
<p>“This  is  simple.”  Practice  Gu  laughed:  ”Can’t  you  just  undergo  the  situation   of  ’recognizing  yourself’?”</p>
<p>“That’s  right!”  Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  realized  at  once.</p>
<p>Practice  Gu  continued:  ”For  a  human,  recognizing  yourself  is  the  most   important  and  also  most  difficult  thing  in  the  world.  Great  Strength  True   Martial,  you  are  strong  and  have  ability,  if  we  work  together,  the  chance  of   success  is  very  high.”</p>
<p>Ability  Gu  laughed  and  said:  ”Undergoing  situations  can  make  me   stronger.”</p>
<p>Carefree  Wisdom  Heart  supported  this,  she  gave  serious  Gu  to  Great   Strength  True  Martial.</p>
<p>Great  Strength  True  Martial  started  to  undergo  situations  alongside  practice   Gu.</p>
<p>They  first  created  a  piece  of  floating  ice  that  was  as  small  as  a  ball.  It   surrounded  Great  Strength  True  Martial  and  practice  Gu  as  a  light   membrane  appeared  around  the  ice  ball.</p>
<p>Ren  Zu  and  Carefree  Wisdom  Heart  stood  on  top  of  the  ice  ball  as  they   flowed  away,  eventually  encountering  year  Gu.</p>
<p>“Is  this  self  Gu?”  Ren  Zu  asked.</p>
<p>Great  Strength  True  Martial  replied:  ”No,  self  Gu  is  smaller  than  it.”</p>
<p>They  continued  to  undergo  situations  within  the  ice  ball  as  ability  Gu  got   stronger,  the  floating  ice  also  became  larger  as  a  water  membrane  appeared   around  the  periphery.</p>
<p>While  floating,  Ren  Zu  saw  month  Gu.</p>
<p>“Is  this  self  Gu?”  Ren  Zu  asked.</p>
<p>Great  Strength  True  Martial  replied:  ”No,  self  Gu  is  smaller  than  it.”</p>
<p>Great  Strength  True  Martial  and  practice  Gu  continued  working  hard,   ability  Gu  got  stronger  and  made  this  floating  ice  even  bigger,  the  periphery   of  the  ice  ball  was  covered  in  a  stone  membrane.</p>
<p>Ren  Zu  saw  day  Gu.</p>
<p>“Is  this  self  Gu?”  Ren  Zu  asked.</p>
<p>Great  Strength  True  Martial  replied:  ”No,  self  Gu  is  smaller  than  it.”</p>
<p>The  stronger  the  ability,  the  more  one  would  find  that  they  were  small  and   insignificant.</p>
<p>Eventually,  the  floating  ice  reached  its  biggest  size,  the  periphery  was   covered  by  a  crystal  membrane.  Ren  Zu  and  the  other  two  floated  on  the  ice   ball  and  eventually  found  self  Gu.</p>
<p>“Self  Gu  is  actually  so  small.”  Ren  Zu  was  internally  shaken.</p>
<p>Cognition  Gu  sighed:  ”In  the  eyes  of  heaven  and  earth,  in  the  eyes  of   mankind,  a  single  self  Gu  is  very  small  and  insignificant.”</p>
