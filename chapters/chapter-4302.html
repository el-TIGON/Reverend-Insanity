        <p>:  Spectral  Soul’s  Anguished  Cry</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  gaze  flickered  with  uncertainty  and  his  expression  was  grim:  ”I   did  not  expect  that  light  Gu  would  erupt  with  an  attack  that  cooperated  with   the  golden  pillar  so  perfectly!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  smiled  smugly:  ”My  soft  gold  crashing  pillar   was  designed  to  counter  your  reverse  flow  protection  seal,  how  does  it   feel?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  nodded:  ”This  move  can  conceal  its  strength  and  unleash  a   mystical  collision  force  on  reverse  flow  protection  seal  to  penetrate  the   Reverse  Flow  River,  interrupting  with  the  entire  operation  of  the  killer   move.”</p>
<p>“But  it  is  a  pity  that  this  move  has  not  been  completed  yet.  Otherwise,  it   would  not  have  been  resolved  by  me  so  easily.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  nodded,  he  felt  that  this  was  a  small  pity,  he   could  have  given  up  on  Light  Emperor  to  save  this  killer  move  for  the   future  to  deal  with  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>But  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  would  not  do  that.</p>
<p>He  would  rather  expose  it  to  save  his  eldest  son.</p>
<p>“I  was  too  rash,  to  think  that  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  would  be  involved.”   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  said  to  Light  Emperor.</p>
<p>“Father,  what’s  the  point  of  saying  that  now?  We  need  to  find  a  way  to  flee!   My  hairs  are  all  standing  on  end  now!”  Light  Emperor  replied  quickly,   although  he  had  returned  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  side,  the  battle   was  still  ongoing,  he  was  very  alert.</p>
<p>“Didn’t  you  create  your  own  light  body  inheritance,  your  entire  body  is   covered  in  light  path  dao  marks,  how  can  you  have  body  hair?”  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  asked  in  a  peculiar  tone.</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  rolled  his  eyes  and  retorted:  ”Father,  now  is  not  the  time  for   this!  The  situation  is  dire,  we  need  to  find  a  way  to  escape.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  suddenly  laughed  out  loud:  ”Then  we  will   leave!”</p>
<p>Saying  so,  he  held  Light  Emperor  and  You  Tian  Guang  in  both  hands   respectively  and  rapidly  made  his  move.</p>
<p>“You  want  to  leave?  Not  so  easy!”</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun,  leave  the  Immortal  Gu  behind.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable   attacked  at  the  same  time.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  roared  and  exchanged  blows  with  the  two   venerables,  even  parts  of  the  two  heavens  broke  into  fragments.</p>
<p>At  the  center  of  the  explosion,  under  the  terrifying  force  of  the  killer  moves,   nothing  remained.</p>
<p>Even  the  fused  immemorial  two  heavens  was  destroyed,  turning  into  an   area  of  void.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  the  surrounding  fragments  of  the  two  heavens  came   rushing  in  like  tidal  waves,  filling  up  the  void.</p>
<p>Using  this  chance,  a  golden  path  extended  over  from  deep  within  Northern   Plains.</p>
<p>It  was  Calamity  Luck  Altar’s  strongest  method  —  Luck  Changing  Golden   Light  Path!</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  purposely  left  Calamity  Luck  Altar  in   Longevity  Heaven  along  with  his  own  will  and  rank  nine  immortal  essence.</p>
<p>Thus,  using  the  vast  number  of  Longevity  Heaven’s  luck  path  dao  marks,   the  power  of  luck  changing  golden  light  path  rose  explosively,  it  extended   from  Northern  Plains  to  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  brought  Light  Emperor  and  You  Tian  Guang   onto  this  path,  their  speed  rose  immensely,  they  went  far  away  in  just  a   moment.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable   did  not  let  them  off.</p>
<p>But  their  attacks  were  negated  by  each  other  due  to  the  constant  accidents   that  occurred  around  the  golden  path.</p>
<p>Even  if  a  venerable  attacked,  under  the  chaotic  situation  of  the  fused  two   heavens,  they  were  not  only  obstructed  by  soul  beasts,  there  were  black- white  overturning  clouds  too.</p>
<p>This  was  the  power  of  luck  changing  golden  light  path.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  attacked  several  times  but  nearly  caused  accidents  to  occur   during  heavenly  secret  Gu’s  refinement!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  seen  the  power  of  luck  changing  golden  light  path  from  long   ago,  but  this  time,  it  was  so  hard  to  deal  with  because  of  the  amplification   of  Longevity  Heaven’s  dao  marks.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Both  venerables  gave  chase  into  Northern  Plains,  eventually,  they  destroyed   the  luck  changing  golden  light  path.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  fell  along  with  Light   Emperor  and  You  Tian  Guang  down,  during  the  entire  period  of  time,  he   could  not  find  a  chance  to  open  his  immortal  aperture’s  entrance.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  been  using  his  full  strength  to  maintain   the  luck  changing  golden  light  path  to  resist  the  two  venerables’  attacks.</p>
<p>The  intensity  of  the  battle  was  clear  with  one  glance!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  fully  displayed  the  power  of  wisdom   path,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  no  time  to  do  anything  else.  There   was  another  reason,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  dare  to  let  You   Tian  Guang  into  his  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>The  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu  was  inside  You  Tian  Guang’s  body,  after   sensing  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  rank  nine  aura,  it  was  feeling  very   restless.</p>
<p>If  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  anything  excessive,  light  Gu  might  get   agitated  and  do  something  unfavorable  to  him.</p>
<p>Thus,  he  could  only  bring  Light  Emperor  and  You  Tian  Guang  towards   Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>“Heavenly  secret  Gu’s  refinement  is  reaching  the  final  few  steps.”  Fang   Yuan  was  very  happy  but  he  showed  an  anxious  expression  as  he  shouted:   ”Giant  Sun,  leave  that  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  behind!  I  won’t  let  you  have   it.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  eyes  showed  a  firm  light,  she  did   not  speak  but  her  attacks  were  getting  more  intense.</p>
<p>The  battle  of  the  three  venerables  finally  got  close  to  Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  laughed  loudly  as  victory  was  in  sight,  he  shouted:  ”Father   is  mighty!”</p>
<p>Longevity  Heaven’s  immortal  aperture  entrance  was  open,  at  the  final   juncture,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  showed  a  grim  expression,  he  did   not  dare  to  be  careless  for  fear  of  showing  a  flaw.</p>
<p>The  moment  he  stepped  into  the  immortal  aperture’s  entrance,  rank  nine   light  Gu  sensed  something  amiss,  it  suddenly  reacted  and  wanted  to  escape.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly  and  used  his  prepared  method   to  suppress  it.</p>
<p>But  at  this  moment,  Fang  Yuan  unleashed  his  refinement  path  killer  move!</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  used  his  defensive  measure  but  the   refinement  path  killer  move  had  been  prepared  by  Fang  Yuan  for  a  long   time,  it  had  incredible  power  that  affected  rank  nine  light  Gu.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>With  a  soft  sound,  the  surface  of  light  Gu  cracked.</p>
<p>“Oh,  oh  no!”  Light  Emperor  shouted.</p>
<p>But  thankfully,  light  Gu  was  only  injured,  it  survived  and  was  not  destroyed   by  Fang  Yuan’s  attack.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  stepped  into  Longevity  Heaven  at  long  last,   he  looked  at  Fang  Yuan  angrily  as  he  asked:  ”Heaven  Refining  Demon   Venerable!  What  an  impressive  method…  what  is  the  name  of  your  move?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  smiled  coldly:  ”You  have  your  soft  gold  crashing  pillar,  I  have   my  crippled  refinement.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  praised  it  again  before  looking  at  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  he  shut  the  door  and  vanished  into  thin   air.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  looked  at  Fang  Yuan  with  a  livid   expression,  she  reprimanded:  ”Since  you  had  the  killer  move  crippled   refinement  all  along,  why  did  you  not  use  it  earlier?  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  succeeded  in  the  end!”</p>
<p>All  along,  she  did  not  notice  that  something  was  off  with  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  gritted  his  teeth,  his  expression  was  dark:  ”If  I  had  not  made   deductions  during  the  battle,  even  that  last  hit  would  not  have  been   possible!  I  managed  to  injure  light  Gu,  but  what  about  you,  Star   Constellation?”</p>
<p>“Hmph.  If  I  did  not  stall  for  time,  could  you  have  achieved  that?”  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  very  unhappy,  she  did  not  want  to   waste  time  talking  to  Fang  Yuan,  she  turned  around  and  left.</p>
<p>The  entire  time,  neither  of  them  chose  to  invade  Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>“Having  your  own  headquarters  is  really  convenient.”  Fang  Yuan  sighed   and  left.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  heavily  injured,  but  because  of   Longevity  Heaven,  he  was  unbeatable  once  he  returned.</p>
<p>“This  is  true  for  Longevity  Heaven,  Heavenly  Court  is  even  more   terrifying.”  Fang  Yuan  made  deductions  from  seeing  luck  changing  golden   light  path’s  strength,  he  could  not  help  but  feel  a  chill.</p>
<p>He  did  not  stay  in  Northern  Plains,  he  returned  to  Eastern  Sea  immediately.</p>
<p>The  effect  of  obscured  heavenly  secret  that  he  had  was  greatly  expended   after  this  intense  battle,  barely  any  was  left.</p>
<p>Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>“Father,  how  is  light  Gu?”  Light  Emperor  was  very  concerned.</p>
<p>“Don’t  worry,  although  Fang  Yuan  is  a  refinement  path  venerable  and   heavily  injured  light  Gu,  I  used  that  opportunity  to  suppress  it  as  well.”   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  coughed  and  spat  out  some  blood.</p>
<p>“Father,  are  you  okay?”  Light  Emperor  asked.</p>
<p>In  his  memory,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  so  magnificent  and   strong,  he  was  an  invincible  existence.  But  now,  he  saw  that  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  was  tired  and  battered.</p>
<p>Times  were  different!</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  recalled  the  process  and  felt  dejected.  As  a  pseudo   venerable,  he  was  nothing  more  than  a  useless  tool.</p>
<p>At  most,  he  was  the  bait  that  lured  light  Gu.</p>
<p>In  this  battle,  he  was  a  burden  for  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable!</p>
<p>“Father,  go  and  heal  yourself.”  Light  Emperor  was  very  worried,  he  had   never  seen  his  father  with  such  serious  injuries.</p>
<p>But  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  shook  his  head:  ”I  need  to  watch  them   and  make  sure  they  leave  Northern  Plains,  I  can’t  let  them  cause  destruction   or  slaughter  the  Huang  Jin  tribes.”</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  was  shocked:  ”They  are  grand  venerables,  how  can  they  act   like  that?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  shook  his  head  again:  ”Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  may  not  do  it,  but  Fang  Yuan  is  crafty  and  shameless,  I   cannot  be  sure  of  that.  But  most  importantly,  we  obtained  a  rank  nine   Immortal  Gu  in  this  fight,  the  gains  are  just  too  much.  You  are  truly  my   son.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  praise  made  Light  Emperor  feel  more   energetic,  he  patted  his  chest  and  assured:  ”Father,  I  will  do  my  best.  Cough   cough!”</p>
<p>Because  he  patted  himself  too  hard,  he  could  not  help  but  spit  out  some   blood  in  response.</p>
<p>The  father  and  son  looked  at  each  other  with  bitter  smiles.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  waved  his  hand:  ”You  are  heavily  injured   too,  go  and  recuperate.  We  made  the  greatest  gains  this  time,  we  need  to   rest  now  and  digest  our  gains.  Once  our  strength  rises,  we  will  repay  them   severalfold.”</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  hesitated:  ”Father,  light  Gu  is  injured,  what  do  we  do?  Even   Heavenly  Court  spent  a  long  time  and  countless  resources  to  repair  fate   Gu.”</p>
<p>Speaking  of  this,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  frowned:  ”We’ll  talk  about   it  in  the  future.”</p>
<p>Above  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>All  sorts  of  fire  path  immortal  materials  were  gathered  by  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  and  sent  into  Heavenly  Court’s  treasury.</p>
<p>“The  star  array  calculation  formation  was  not  too  badly  interrupted.”  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  pleased  about  this.</p>
<p>In  her  case,  this  battle  was  too  abrupt.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  expend  much  immortal   essence  but  the  gains  were  plentiful.</p>
<p>“Even  though  Giant  Sun  obtained  rank  nine  light  Gu,  it  is  an  injured   Immortal  Gu.  Giant  Sun  cultivates  luck  path  and  blood  path,  he  cannot  use   light  Gu  easily.”</p>
<p>“Rank  nine  light  Gu  is  not  derivation  Gu,  the  latter  does  not  need  to  be   refined  but  the  former  needs  immortal  essence  to  be  used.  This  will  cost   Giant  Sun  a  lot  of  immortal  essence.”</p>
<p>“It  is  possible  that  Fang  Yuan  created  crippled  refinement  at  the  last  second,   but  it  is  more  likely  that  he  did  not  attack  because  he  lacked  immortal   essence,  because  it  was  too  urgent  at  the  end,  he  exposed  the  killer  move  to   attempt  to  destroy  light  Gu.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  looked  towards  the  two  heavens.</p>
<p>Without  the  sun,  both  heavens  were  dark  and  dim.</p>
<p>Deep  within  the  two  heavens,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  covered   in  fire,  he  was  growling  in  pain.</p>
<p>This  was  the  price  for  swallowing  rank  nine  fire  Gu!</p>
<p>“This  might  be  a  chance.”  Starlight  flickered  in  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  eyes,  she  was  very  concerned  with  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable’s  situation.</p>
