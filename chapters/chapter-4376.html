    <p>:  Giant  Sun  Accidentally  Harms  His  Son</p>
<p>Even  before  the  Huang  Jin  tribes  asked  for  help,  Longevity  Heaven  had   already  detected  the  commotion  in  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land.</p>
<p>Bing  Sai  Chuan  was  overseeing  Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>He  was  having  a  discussion  with  Yao  Huang  and  some  of  the  Eight   Extremities.</p>
<p>“The  commotion  in  the  fierce  area  is  no  small  matter,  we  have  to  take  care   of  it.”</p>
<p>“In  my  opinion,  we  must  verify  the  reason  for  the  commotion!”</p>
<p>“Maybe  because  the  sun  was  destroyed  and  spectral  heaven  formed,  it   caused  light  path  to  decline  and  dark  path  to  prosper.  Flower  Forest   Forbidden  Land  has  a  dense  number  of  dark  path  dao  marks.”</p>
<p>After  the  discussion,  Bing  Sai  Chuan  personally  moved  towards  the  fierce   area  to  inspect  the  situation  while  the  others  continued  to  guard  Longevity   Heaven.</p>
<p>The  reason  for  this  arrangement  was  because  Bing  Sai  Chuan  possessed  a   time  path  killer  move  that  could  trace  an  event  to  its  source  and  see  the  truth   in  the  past.</p>
<p>Longevity  Heaven  opened  its  entrance  as  Bing  Sai  Chuan  moved  directly  to   Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land.</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  who  was  already  hiding  in  spectral  heaven  was  near  Longevity   Heaven’s  entrance.</p>
<p>it  saw  the  entrance  open  and  close  but  did  not  move.</p>
<p>The  opening  of  the  entrance  was  indeed  an  excellent  chance  to  enter  the   grotto-heaven  but  it  was  too  conspicuous.  Even  if  Zuo  Ye  Hui  had   concealment  methods,  it  was  not  easy  to  do  this.</p>
<p>Gu  Immortals  were  deeply  concerned  whenever  they  opened  their  immortal   aperture.  If  Zuo  Ye  Hui  entered  at  this  time,  it  was  simply  exposing  itself   and  looking  for  trouble,  and  it  was  also  underestimating  Bing  Sai  Chuan.</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  did  not  want  to  have  a  frontal  fight.</p>
<p>It  might  be  a  grand  legendary  immemorial  beast  but  it  was  nothing  when   compared  to  Longevity  Heaven  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>From  the  start,  it  had  not  thought  of  forcefully  intruding  to  save  You  Tian   Guang. The  rescue  was  a  technical  operation,  if  it  acted  rashly,  it  was  likely   to  fail  and  even  cause  himself  to  get  captured!</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  continued  to  hide  and  activate  a  killer  move.</p>
<p>“This  opportunity  is  extremely  rare,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  is   fighting  the  other  three  venerables  and  has  no  leisure  time  to  split  his   concentration.  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land  lured  away  a  rank  eight   expert.  The  specific  location  of  Longevity  Heaven’s  entrance  is  also   exposed.  I  must  make  the  best  use  of  this  time!”</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  and  You  Tian  Guang  had  a  mysterious  connection.</p>
<p>Relying  on  this  connection,  Zuo  Ye  Hui’s  dark  path  killer  move  gradually   showed  a  miraculous  effect.</p>
<p>Inside  Longevity  Heaven,  You  Tian  Guang  was  imprisoned  in  Calamity   Luck  Altar.</p>
<p>Suddenly  having  a  sensation,  You  Tian  Guang  lowered  its  head  and  looked   at  its  heart.  Shortly  after,  it  reacted,  roaring  and  struggling  fiercely.</p>
<p>Calamity  Luck  Altar  shook  constantly,  the  Eight  Extremities,  who  were   guarding  outside,  saw  this  and  quickly  acted  to  suppress  You  Tian  Guang.</p>
<p>“You  Tian  Guang,  you  have  tried  so  many  times  but  still  haven’t  realized   that  you  can’t  escape  Calamity  Luck  Altar  by  yourself?”</p>
<p>“Surrendering  to  my  Longevity  Heaven  is  your  only  way  out.”</p>
<p>“As  long  as  you  surrender  to  Longevity  Heaven,  you  will  be  protected  by   Lord  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.”</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  roared  furiously:  ”Return  my  light  Gu!”</p>
<p>The  Eight  Extremities  persuaded:  ”You  Tian  Guang,  light  Gu  has  always   been  a  wild  Gu,  it  only  resided  in  your  body  temporarily,  how  can  you  call   it  yours?”</p>
<p>“That’s  correct.  Lord  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  won  against  two   venerables  and  seized  this  Gu,  it  belongs  to  my  Longevity  Heaven  now!”</p>
<p>“You  should  be  grateful  to  Lord  Immortal  Venerable  and  his  son,  if  not  for   them,  you  would  have  already  been  killed  by  Star  Constellation  or  Fang   Yuan.”</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang’s  aura  declined  rapidly  from  their  suppression  but  it  still   shouted:  ”Return  my  light  Gu  and  I  will  consider  surrendering!”</p>
<p>The  few  Eight  Extremities  looked  at  each  other  before  shaking  their  heads   and  strengthening  the  suppression  power  of  Calamity  Luck  Altar.</p>
<p>Finally,  You  Tian  Guang  exhausted  all  its  strength  and  gave  up  with   reluctance,  hatred,  and  anger  as  it  was  suppressed.</p>
<p>But  this  time,  it  had  a  new  hope.</p>
<p>“Brother,  I  am  coming  to  save  you,  let’s  discuss  the  plan  first!”  A  lump  of   black  liquid  flowed  out  of  You  Tian  Guang’s  heart  and  turned  into  the   appearance  of  a  mini  Zuo  Ye  Hui.</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  paused  for  a  moment  before  continuing:  ”My  killer  move  has   gone  through  modification  and  will  continue  to  accumulate  strength  inside   your  body.  When  it  has  accumulated  enough  strength,  you  can  use  my   strength  to  erupt  with  all  your  power.  At  that  time,  I  will  coordinate  with   you  from  outside  Longevity  Heaven  and  open  a  hole  in  Longevity  Heaven!”</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  did  not  feel  at  ease:  ”Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  cannot   be  underestimated,  be  careful  of  him,  you  must  not  trap  yourself.”</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  informed  You  Tian  Guang  of  the  current  situation.</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  was  exulted:  ”The  chaotic  battle  of  four  venerables  will   probably  last  for  a  long  time.  This  is  indeed  the  best  time  for  me  to  escape!   It  is  a  pity  that  your  arrangements  in  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land  only   lured  away  Bing  Sai  Chuan.”</p>
<p>“Longevity  Heaven  is  probably  cautious  because  of  Fang  Yuan.  Fang   Yuan’s  three  clones  are  wreaking  havoc  in  Central  Continent  and  the  star   array  calculation  formation  is  already  damaged.”  Zuo  Ye  Hui  analyzed.</p>
<p>The  two  legendary  immemorial  beasts  conversed  secretly,  no  one  in   Longevity  Heaven  sensed  it.</p>
<p>Bing  Sai  Chuan  quietly  landed  in  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land.</p>
<p>He  searched  all  the  way  and  traced  the  aura  to  its  source,  gradually  nearing   the  area  where  Zuo  Ye  Hui  set  up  the  immortal  formation.</p>
<p>“There  is  trouble!”  Lu  Qing  Ming  and  Su  Guang  who  were  controlling  the   formation  sensed  Bing  Sai  Chuan  early  on.</p>
<p>Their  expressions  were  heavy  as  they  knew  the  severity  of  the  situation.</p>
<p>Once  they  were  discovered  by  Bing  Sai  Chuan,  there  would  be  no  way  for   them  to  escape.</p>
<p>The  two  had  thought  of  surrendering  but  they  were  under  the  control  of  Zuo   Ye  Hui’s  dark  path  method.  As  long  as  they  even  tried  to  surrender,  the  dark   path  method  would  trigger  and  take  their  lives.</p>
<p>They  two  had  to  continue  to  activate  the  immortal  formation  and  enlarge  the   scale  of  the  beast  tide,  they  could  not  stop  for  even  a  while.</p>
<p>Otherwise,  the  dark  path  method  would  similarly  trigger  and  kill  them   directly.</p>
<p>“Zuo  Ye  Hui  is  using  us  as  cannon  fodder!”</p>
<p>“Sigh,  I  did  not  expect  today  that  we  will  die  today.”</p>
<p>Just  as  the  two  were  in  despair,  the  situation  suddenly  took  a  turn  for  the   better.</p>
<p>“Who  is  it?!”  Bing  Sai  Chuan  stopped,  his  gaze  emitting  cold  light  as  he   became  vigilant.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  mind  jolted  slightly.</p>
<p>He  had  come  to  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land  secretly  and  was  concealed.   His  goal  was  to  gather  some  precious  and  rare  immortal  materials  to  help   him  complete  the  sword  forest  killer  move.</p>
<p>But  then,  the  beast  tide  occurred.</p>
<p>This  was  a  good  thing  for  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>The  chaotic  situation  was  much  more  suitable  for  him  to  look  for  benefits.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  entered  deep  inside  the  fierce  area  and  ran  into  Bing  Sai   Chuan.</p>
<p>Although  he  had  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength,  he  was  not  proficient  at   concealment  methods.  Fortunately,  Bing  Sai  Chuan  looked  around  a  few   times  before  shaking  his  head.</p>
<p>“Maybe  I  was  wrong?”</p>
<p>Bing  Sai  Chuan  whispered  softly  before  continuing  forward  while   inspecting  the  area.</p>
<p>He  did  not  notice  any  suspicious  interference  in  this  beast  tide  but  he  also   did  not  find  the  reason  for  the  beast  tide’s  outbreak.</p>
<p>He  followed  the  traces  to  their  source  and  gradually  neared  the  dark  path   immortal  formation.</p>
<p>Right  at  this  time,  a  group  of  four-legged  white  scale  snake  flew  over.</p>
<p>The  white  scale  snakes  had  already  turned  mad,  when  they  discovered  Bing   Sai  Chuan,  they  attacked  immediately  without  thinking.</p>
<p>Bing  Sai  Chuan’s  pupils  shrank  and  was  about  to  kill  these  snakes  when  a   ray  of  sword  qi  shot  towards  him  from  the  left.</p>
<p>Bing  Sai  Chuan  was  not  surprised  and  quickly  acted  to  block  the  sword  qi   while  saying  to  Lin  Jian  Xing  who  had  revealed  himself:  ”Hehe,  I  knew   there  was  someone  there…  hmm?  Lin  Jian  Xing!”</p>
<p>Bing  Sai  Chuan  recognized  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>After  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  lost  to  Lin  Jian  Xing,  his   appearance  was  already  spread  widely,  Bing  Sai  Chuan  naturally  knew  of   him.</p>
<p>Bing  Sai  Chuan’s  brows  furrowed  tightly:  ”Lin  Jian  Xing,  do  you  want  to   stand  against  my  Longevity  Heaven?”</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  frowned  but  he  looked  at  the  group  of  white  scale  snakes:   ”These  white  scale  snakes’  tongues  are  sword  path  immortal  materials  that  I   require.  I  came  for  them  this  time.  Bing  Sai  Chuan,  I  seek  your   understanding.”</p>
<p>“Is  that  so?”  Bing  Sai  Chuan  was  doubtful  but  Lin  Jian  Xing  was  a  pseudo   venerable  after  all,  he  did  not  want  to  start  a  fight  rashly,  ”These  white  scale   snakes’  tongues  are  indeed  rare  resources.  But  don’t  worry,  Lin  Jian  Xing,   Longevity  Heaven  has  many  of  them  in  our  storage.  If  you  are  interested,  I   am  willing  to  deepen  our  friendship  and  gift  them  to  you.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”  Lin  Jian  Xing  raised  his  brows  slightly.  He  was  just  about  to   consider  when  a  large  group  of  immemorial  desolate  beast  rushed  towards   this  area.</p>
<p>The  scene  became  chaotic  immediately.</p>
<p>The  white  scale  snakes  were  only  ancient  desolate  beasts,  they  were  not  the   match  of  these  immemorial  desolate  beasts.  But  it  was  too  late  to  escape   now,  their  formation  was  scattered  by  the  immemorial  desolate  beasts.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  attacked  these  immemorial  desolate  beasts  and  retrieved  as   many  white  scale  snake  tongues  as  he  could.</p>
<p>Bing  Sai  Chuan  observed  from  the  side  while  urgently  contacting  Longevity   Heaven  to  mobilize  the  Harem  Palaces  of  Northern  Plains  and  Western   Desert.</p>
<p>He  would  not  easily  believe  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  one-sided  statement,  it  was   much  safer  to  use  Immortal  Gu  Houses  to  face  a  pseudo  venerable.</p>
<p>Back  then,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  gathered  beauties  and   constructed  five  harem  palaces  in  the  five  regions  which  were  all  Immortal   Gu  Houses.</p>
<p>A  few  members  of  the  Eight  Extremities  received  the  command  and   immediately  flew  out  of  Longevity  Heaven  with  the  Immortal  Gu  Houses.</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  was  doubtful  and  happy  at  this  sight.</p>
<p>In  fact,  Lu  Qing  Ming  and  Su  Guang  still  being  concealed  at  this  point  was   already  beyond  Zuo  Ye  Hui’s  expectations.</p>
<p>Right  now,  Longevity  Heaven  sent  two  Immortal  Gu  Houses  and  several   Gu  Immortals,  their  direction  was  clearly  Flower  Forest  Forbidden  Land;   Zuo  Ye  Hui  could  not  understand  what  was  going  on.</p>
<p>But  no  matter  what,  his  situation  had  become  better  than  before.</p>
<p>After  a  while,  You  Tian  Guang  roared  fiercely,  erupting  with  the   accumulated  dark  path  strength  and  catching  the  Eight  Extremities,  who   were  guarding  this  place,  off-guard.</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  seized  this  chance  and  attacked.  After  ten  breaths  of  time   of  stalemate,  it  was  able  to  charge  out  of  Calamity  Luck  Altar.</p>
<p>It  did  not  escape  immediately,  instead,  it  followed  its  sense  towards  a   secluded  area.</p>
<p>The  Eight  Extremities  left  behind  were  pale  with  fright:  ”Oh  no!  That  is   where  our  prince  is  resting!!”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  had  already  come  out  of  Blood  Sea  and  wanted  to  stop  You  Tian   Guang,  but  he  was  a  step  late.</p>
<p>He  watched  with  the  newly  arrived  Mao  Li  Qiu  as  You  Tian  Guang  took   Light  Emperor  and  left.</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  was  nourishing  rank  nine  light  Gu  with  his  body.  Even  under   such  a  drastic  situation,  he  was  still  like  a  statue  with  his  eyes  closed  as  if   he  had  lost  all  perception  towards  the  outside  world.</p>
<p>“Don’t  provoke  me  or  I  may  crush  him  to  death!”  You  Tian  Guang  roared   loudly,  the  encircling  Gu  Immortals  hesitated  and  were  in  a  dilemma.</p>
<p>“Don’t  kill  him,  otherwise  when  Lord  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   returns,  you  will  definitely  die!”</p>
<p>“You  Tian  Guang,  everything  can  be  discussed,  please  calm  down.”</p>
<p>“Quick,  call  Bing  Sai  Chuan  and  the  others  to  come  back.”</p>
<p>While  the  Longevity  Heaven  Gu  Immortals  were  panicking,  You  Tian   Guang  made  a  move.  Zuo  Ye  Hui  also  came  out  of  hiding  in  the  outside   world,  the  two  had  a  high  degree  of  coordination,  directly  tearing  open  a   hole  in  Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>This  hole  was  not  large  but  You  Tian  Guang  had  an  amazing  method.</p>
<p>He  first  swallowed  Light  Emperor  before  transforming  his  body  into  a  lump   of  light  that  forced  its  way  through  the  hole  and  into  the  outside  world.</p>
<p>After  appearing  in  the  outside  world,  the  light  changed  back  into  You  Tian   Guang.</p>
<p>Longevity  Heaven’s  Gu  Immortals  gave  chase  and  arrived  outside,  they  saw   You  Tian  Guang  and  their  expressions  turned  unsightly  when  the  saw  Zuo   Ye  Hui  as  well.</p>
<p>“We  fell  for  their  trap!”  Yao  Huang  stomped  his  foot  in  anger.</p>
<p>After  Bing  Sai  Chuan  received  the  news,  he  looked  at  Lin  Jian  Xing  with   narrowed  eyes:  ”So  it  was  like  this,  Brother  Lin  actually  joined  hands  with   Zuo  Ye  Hui.”</p>
<p>“What  do  you  mean?”  Lin  Jian  Xing  was  baffled.</p>
<p>In  the  battlefield  over  the  heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>“What?”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  been  concentrating  on  fighting   Fang  Yuan  when  he  heard  this  bad  news.</p>
<p>“This  situation  seems  to  be  created  by  my  nothing  is  certain  except  success   killer  move!”  The  vague  luck  path  sensation  stupefied  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  explain  the  situation  to  himself   but  he  was  not  able  to!</p>
<p>“My  killer  move  should…  not  have  a  problem,  right?”</p>
<p>“I  rarely  used  it  in  my  previous  life.”</p>
<p>“I  have  modified  this  move  recently,  indeed…  there  should  be…   probably…  not  much  of  an  issue.”</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun,  what  happened?”  As  the  number  one  person  in  wisdom  path,   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  very  perceptive  towards  the   changes  of  emotions,  she  asked  directly.</p>
<p>“Ah,  nothing,  there  is  no  issue.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  shook  his   hands  repeatedly  while  feeling  bitter  inwardly.</p>
