    <p>:  Explosion!!!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  saw  the  issue,  the  qi  path  immortal   materials  were  insufficient,  her  expression  turned  dim.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  foundation  had  finally  hit  rock-bottom!</p>
<p>In  fact,  when  she  set  up  the  star  array  calculation  formation  and  nurtured   the  immemorial  star  beasts,  she  had  already  expended  all  of  Heavenly   Court’s  star  path  resources.</p>
<p>Recently,  Heavenly  Court’s  members  revived  continuously,  the  remaining   immortal  graveyard  was  also  consumed  until  only  a  small  area  was  left,  it   could  no  longer  allow  any  Gu  Immortal  to  revive.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  had  developed  for  three  million  years,  it  had  incomparable   foundation,  but  after  several  huge  battles,  the  expenditure  was  severe.  When   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  escaped  from  Heavenly  Court,  he   ransacked  the  immortal  treasury.  They  had  to  use  their  secret  storage  and   even  subtly  draw  resources  from  the  ten  great  ancient  sects.</p>
<p>Until  today,  Heavenly  Court  was  already  showing  signs  of  exhausting  its   foundation.</p>
<p>Of  course,  the  main  reason  why  they  were  out  of  qi  path  resources  was   because  the  immortal  material  expenditure  was  just  too  high.</p>
<p>In  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  original  plan,  the  qi  harvest  fruit   would  primarily  grow  using  the  qi  tides,  the  qi  path  methods  he  left  behind   would  only  be  a  failsafe  in  case  any  unexpected  mishaps  occurred.</p>
<p>The  qi  tides  were  crucial  in  growing  the  qi  harvest  fruit.</p>
<p>But  now,  the  qi  tides  had  ended  and  the  qi  paths  methods  were  not   completely  intact,  they  had  to  expend  qi  path  immortal  materials  instead.</p>
<p>It  was  obvious  that  the  more  qi  path  immortal  materials  they  expended,  the   larger  the  qi  harvest  fruit  would  become,  and  the  stronger  Primordial  Origin   Immortal  Venerable  would  be  after  reviving.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  made  deductions  again.</p>
<p>She  used  her  full  strength  in  doing  this,  countless  thoughts  collided  in  her   mind  until  she  felt  a  sharp  headache,  but  she  eventually  deduced  another   killer  move.</p>
<p>After  testing  it,  she  modified  the  killer  move  slightly.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  breathing  was  quite  rough  and  her   expression  was  pale,  she  opened  the  entrance  of  Heavenly  Court  at  the  next   moment.</p>
<p>Before  any  other  venerable  reacted,  she  aimed  her  killer  move  at  the   entrance.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  entrance  was  immediately  covered  by  a  layer  of  profound   light  as  it  rapidly  drew  in  heaven  and  earth  qi  from  the  outside  world.</p>
<p>The  heaven  and  earth  qi  were  vast  and  boundless,  they  entered  through  the   entrance  with  unceasing  momentum  and  flowed  into  the  immortal   formation.</p>
<p>The  heaven  and  earth  qi  were  not  of  high  quality  but  could  compensate  with   quantity,  with  this  supplement,  the  growth  of  the  qi  harvest  fruit  was  no   longer  an  issue.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  immortals  were  shocked,  they  quickly  discussed.</p>
<p>“Why  did  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  open  the  entrance  of   Heavenly  Court?”</p>
<p>“This  is  a  good  thing,  the  stronger  the  qi  harvest  fruit,  the  more  powerful   Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  qi  path  foundation  will  be  after   revival!”</p>
<p>“What  if  Fang  Yuan  attacks  using  this  chance?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha,  didn’t  he  try  to  attack  earlier,  losing  to  Lady  Star  Constellation’s   divine  might.  Will  he  dare  to  come  again?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  show  up  indeed.</p>
<p>Not  only  that,  even  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  not  paying   attention  to  them.</p>
<p>He  ravaged  Central  Continent  and  slaughtered  countless  beings,  his  injuries   recovered  by  a  large  extent.</p>
<p>Soul  fog  surged,  wherever  it  went,  verdant  mountains  turned  grey  and   flowers  wilted,  wild  beast  corpses  were  lying  all  over  the  place.</p>
<p>As  his  soul  howl  was  used,  huge  waves  appeared  on  the  lakes.  Afterwards,   corpses  of  aquatic  animals  like  fish  or  shrimps  floated  to  the  surface.</p>
<p>A  vast  number  of  souls  were  devoured  by  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,   he  was  like  a  huge  black  hole  that  devoured  everything  he  slaughtered,  his   injuries  were  healed  and  his  body  expanded  again.</p>
<p>During  this  process,  a  wild  Immortal  Gu  was  created  in  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable’s  body.</p>
<p>Rank  eight  Immortal  Gu  —  Kill!</p>
<p>This  caused  a  considerable  commotion  that  drew  the  attention  of  Fang   Yuan,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>At  once,  the  three  venerables  had  strange  expressions.</p>
<p>They  knew  about  a  secret  of  the  past.</p>
<p>Back  then,  Spectral  Soul  wanted  to  create  killing  path,  but  in  the  end,  he   failed  after  devouring  black  heaven’s  heavenly  spirit,  he  was  forced  to   create  soul  path  instead.</p>
<p>But  to  think  that  he  showed  signs  of  creating  killing  path  now  while  he  was   not  sane.</p>
<p>Immortal  Gu  Kill  was  clearly  the  core  Immortal  Gu  of  killing  path,  it  was   not  formed  so  easily.</p>
<p>This  was  a  Gu  refinement  undergone  by  the  Heavenly  Dao!</p>
<p>Most  importantly,  it  was  refined  in  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  body,   this  meant  that  although  he  was  currently  not  sane,  he  was  quite  close  to   creating  killing  path.</p>
<p>“Killing  path  is  already  showing  signs  of  emerging.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  had  already  returned  to  Northern  Plains,  he  immediately  ordered   the  Huang  Jin  tribe  Gu  Immortals  who  were  headed  to  Central  Continent  to   not  get  near  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable!  They  should  not  be  greedy   with  super  resource  points,  also  avoiding  Heaven  Refining  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  personally  plunder  Central   Continent’s  resource  points  but  he  did  not  give  up,  he  sent  his  bloodline   descendants.</p>
<p>This  way,  even  if  Heavenly  Court  pursued  the  matter,  he  had  a  degree  of   distance  and  could  give  excuses.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun,  if  you  come  and  cooperate  with  me,  I’ll  give  you  half  of  the   Central  Continent  resource  points  that  I  plunder!”  Fang  Yuan  transmitted   again,  he  did  not  give  up  on  convincing  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  rejected  with  an  increasingly  firm  attitude.</p>
<p>On  one  hand,  he  felt  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  would  not   expose  a  weakness,  this  outcome  was  already  decided,  there  was  no  point  in</p>
<p>joining  hands  with  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>On  the  other  hand,  he  had  his  own  reservations.</p>
<p>Firstly,  his  eldest  son  You  Tian  Guang  was  taken  away  by  You  Tian  Guang   in  Longevity  Heaven,  he  needed  to  look  for  his  son.</p>
<p>Secondly,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  already  used  ’I  reside  in  all   living  beings  and  heaven  and  earth’  twice  in  a  short  period,  this  move  had  a   huge  drawback,  it  would  leave  him  in  a  weakened  state  for  some  time.  He   had  to  conceal  himself  and  secretly  get  through  this  weakened  period.  If  he   exposed  this  weakness,  the  killer  move’s  value  and  usability  would  fall   immensely  in  the  future.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>The  qi  harvest  fruit  continued  to  grow  larger.</p>
<p>The  vast  amount  of  heaven  and  earth  qi,  countless  qi  path  immortal   materials,  as  well  as  methods  like  the  primordial  qi  wall,  were  all  turned   into  qi  path  dao  marks  that  were  added  into  the  qi  harvest  fruit.</p>
<p>At  the  core  of  the  qi  harvest  fruit,  a  human  shaped  core  was  formed.</p>
<p>As  time  passed,  the  core’s  features  became  clearer,  it  was  increasingly   human-like.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  saw  this  and  immediately   comprehended  that  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival  method   contained  the  profundity  of  human  path.</p>
<p>“To  think  that  master’s  human  path  attainment  is  even  higher  than  I   thought.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  smiled  faintly  as  memories  surfaced   in  her  mind.</p>
<p>In  his  bed,  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  suddenly  coughed  out   blood.</p>
<p>“Master,  how  are  you?”  Star  Constellation  quickly  came  over  and  used  her   methods  to  heal  him.</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  had  just  blocked  a  chaotic  disaster   and  fixed  the  hole  in  the  world,  he  was  heavily  injured  and  could  barely  get   up.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  did  her  best  to  stabilize  his  injuries.</p>
<p>She  had  a  look  of  surprise,  she  found  that  Primordial  Origin  Immortal   Venerable  aggravated  the  injuries  purely  as  a  result  of  his  own  actions!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  frowned  deeply:  ”Master,  you  suffered  such  heavy   injuries  and  can’t  even  walk  now,  yet  you  still  took  a  risk  to  create  a  killer   move!”</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  had  a  look  of  joy:  ”These  injuries  are   not  an  issue,  my  disciple,  I  succeeded.  I  grasped  onto  that  inspiration  and   created  a  human  path  killer  move.”</p>
<p>“Using  this  move,  we  can  use  the  immortal  aperture  to  extend  the  lifespan   of  Gu  Immortals.  Among  all  the  existing  lifespan  extension  methods,  my   newly  created  method  is  the  most  effective!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  looked  at  the  content  and  had  a  gaze  of  surprise,  light   flickered  in  her  eyes  as  she  understood  the  true  value  of  this  killer  move.</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  laughed  loudly:  ”With  this  method,   we  will  not  need  to  force  human  Gu  Immortal  experts  to  join  our  Heavenly   Court.  The  temptation  of  lifespan  extension  is  too  great.”</p>
<p>“From  now  on,  as  long  as  they  contribute  their  immortal  aperture  to   Heavenly  Court,  they  will  become  members  of  Heavenly  Court.  They  will   get  to  use  this  human  path  killer  move  to  extend  their  lifespan.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  nodded,  she  was  joyous  as  well:  ”Master,  what  is  the   name  of  this  killer  move?”</p>
<p>“Cough,  cough.”  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  coughed  before   saying  nonchalantly:  ”The  name  is  not  important,  you  can  decide  it  for  me,   just  make  one  up.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  quickly  answered,  she  loved  to  name  things,  she  added:   ”We  need  to  give  it  an  awesome  name,  it  should  draw  people’s  attention!   Hmm…  let  me  think  about  it.”</p>
<p>“My  good  disciple,  go  and  think  of  the  name!  I  am  too  old  now,  I  don’t   have  the  creativity  anymore.  After  you  decide,  let  me  know.”  Primordial   Origin  Immortal  Venerable  rested  in  bed  and  waved  his  hand  to  Star   Constellation.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  nodded  and  said  solemnly:  ”Master,  you  must  not  take   such  risks  again,  your  injuries  are  too  severe  this  time!”</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  laughed  to  himself:  ”These  injuries   are  nowhere  near  my  limit.  I’ve  once  suffered  even  greater  injuries,  you   know  it  too,  there  has  been  at  least  five  of  such  instances.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  stared  angrily:  ”You  are  already  twenty-five  thousand   years  old,  you  need  to  admit  you  are  old.  You’ve  already  done  enough  for   humanity,  since  you  are  injured,  you  need  to  recuperate.  I  will  lead   Heavenly  Court!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha,  with  you  around,  what  worries  do  I  have?”  Primordial  Origin   Immortal  Venerable  laughed  as  his  voice  became  softer,  he  showed  an   expression  of  dejectedness:  ”Maybe,  I  should  really  admit  that  I  am  too   old…”</p>
<p>“You  won’t.”  Star  Constellation  shook  her  head,  she  showed  an  expression   of  knowing  her  master  very  well  but  being  helpless  against  his  antics.</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  laughed  after  seeing  her  expression,   while  she  was  taking  her  leave,  he  even  winked  at  her  playfully.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  took  care  of  Primordial  Origin,  who  was  recuperating   while  handling  Heavenly  Court’s  affairs,  in  her  free  time,  she  thought  of  the</p>
<p>name  of  the  human  path  killer  move  to  relax  her  mind.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  was  busy  for  three  days,  after  that,  she  finally  had  some   insight  about  the  name  of  the  human  path  killer  move.</p>
<p>But  she  did  not  know  that  she  would  not  have  a  chance  to  tell  Primordial   Origin  Immortal  Venerable  about  this  name  anymore.</p>
<p>When  she  freed  herself  from  her  busy  work  and  went  to  visit  Primordial   Origin  Immortal  Venerable,  she  saw  that  he  was  lying  on  the  bed  quietly,   his  eyes  were  shut  and  his  expression  was  plain,  there  was  only  a  faint  smile   at  the  corners  of  lips.</p>
<p>This  legendary  leader  of  humanity,  the  first  generation  Immortal  King  of   Heavenly  Court,  the  person  who  held  up  the  banner  of  humanity’s   retaliation  and  forced  all  the  variant  human  forces  to  hide  themselves,  had   passed  away.</p>
<p>He  died  calmly.</p>
<p>Peacefully.</p>
<p>Relieved.</p>
<p>His  disciple  was  the  reason  why  he  was  relieved.</p>
<p>The  moment  Star  Constellation  saw  Primordial  Origin  again,  she  realized.</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  injuries  were  extremely  severe,  he   had  only  purposely  concealed  the  fact.</p>
<p>He  was  making  considerations  for  the  big  picture.</p>
<p>After  all,  although  the  variant  humans  retreated  from  Central  Continent,   they  were  still  rampant  in  the  other  four  regions.  Even  in  Central  Continent,</p>
<p>many  variant  human  forces  hid  in  their  blessed  lands  and  grotto-heavens,   they  could  not  be  found.</p>
<p>He  knew  his  injuries  could  not  be  healed,  using  the  last  of  his  strength,  he   painstakingly  created  a  human  path  killer  move  to  aid  the  future   development  of  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  stood  in  front  of  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s   bed  and  kept  silent  for  a  long  time.</p>
<p>Eventually,  she  spoke  in  a  hoarse  voice:  ”Master,  I’ve  already  thought  of   the  name  for  this  human  path  killer  move.  It  suits  this  scenario  quite  well,   I’ll  name  it  —  Lying  in  Bed.”</p>
<p>Lying  in  bed  was  able  to  turn  the  immortal  aperture  that  a  Gu  Immortal   contributed  to  Heavenly  Court  into  a  bed  that  was  free  from  calamities  and   tribulations,  it  could  also  extend  their  lifespan  to  a  great  extent.  Back  in  that   era,  it  was  the  number  one  lifespan  extension  method  besides  lifespan  Gu!</p>
<p>Afterwards,  Star  Constellation  created  another  human  path  killer  move  on   the  foundation  of  this  move,  naming  it  —  Others  Sleep  Soundly.</p>
<p>Others  sleep  soundly  allowed  the  Heavenly  Court  members  to  sleep  on  their   respective  beds  and  reduce  their  body  activity  and  time  flow  to  the  lowest   possible  limit.  At  the  same  time,  their  will  would  be  extracted  and   converted  into  human  nature[1.  Opposite  of  heaven  nature  Spectral  Soul  is   filled  by,  see  2265]  to  help  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  resist   heaven’s  will  after  she  assimilated  with  the  Dao.</p>
<p>At  the  final  moments  of  his  life,  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  lay   in  bed  and  contributed  his  final  moments  to  the  future  of  Heavenly  Court   and  all  of  humanity.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  the  same,  in  order  to  protect   Heavenly  Court,  she  sacrificed  herself  and  became  one  with  the  Dao.</p>
<p>This  pair  of  master  and  disciple  were  truly  of  the  same  lineage!</p>
<p>Lying  in  bed  and  others  sleep  soundly  became  the  foundation  of  Heavenly   Court’s  immortal  graveyard.</p>
<p>Within  the  qi  harvest  fruit,  the  human  shaped  core  had  already  grown  to  the   size  of  a  normal  human  adult.</p>
<p>There  was  a  change  in  the  qi  harvest  fruit’s  skin  as  well,  countless   primordial  qi  walls  formed  and  wrapped  around  the  core  of  the  qi  harvest   fruit.</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival  was  already  reaching  the   final  steps.</p>
<p>The  methods  displayed  during  this  process  made  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  quite  surprised,  she  gasped  and  sighed  at  the  intricacy   of  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  qi  path  methods.</p>
<p>As  time  passed,  a  wave  of  grand  aura  permeated  the  qi  harvest  fruit.</p>
<p>The  qi  path  dao  marks  that  were  created  from  heaven  and  earth  qi,  along   with  the  qi  path  immortal  materials,  were  added  to  the  qi  harvest  fruit   continuously.</p>
<p>The  human  shaped  qi  harvest  fruit  was  already  showing  Primordial  Origin   Immortal  Venerable’s  form.</p>
<p>Many  Central  Continent  Gu  Immortals  were  currently  kneeling.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  members  had  tears  in  their  eyes,  they  were  incredibly   excited.</p>
<p>He  was  the  first  venerable  of  the  world,  among  them,  he  was  also  the  one   with  the  longest  lifespan.</p>
<p>Without  him,  humanity  would  not  have  its  current  prosperity,  he  was  the   person  who  led  the  rise  of  the  human  race!</p>
<p>He  was  the  creator  of  qi  path  and  had  left  behind  countless  methods  to   defend  Heavenly  Court,  including  primordial  qi  wall,  lying  in  bed,  and   others.</p>
<p>He  had  defeated  countless  variant  human  experts,  he  had  suffered  countless   injuries,  who  knows  how  much  blood  he  lost  in  the  process.</p>
<p>He  created  Emperor  City,  which  was  the  incomplete  form  of  Divine   Emperor  City.</p>
<p>He  was  the  first  to  contribute  his  immortal  aperture,  he  gave  up  on  the  clan   system  and  recruited  disciples,  he  was  the  role  model  of  Central  Continent’s   sect  system.</p>
<p>He  worked  his  hardest  and  gave  his  life  to  Heavenly  Court  and  all  of   humanity.</p>
<p>Even  the  variant  humans  who  hated  him  to  the  core  had  to  admit  that  he   was  a  grand  existence.</p>
<p>He  was  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable!</p>
<p>And  today,  he  was  going  to  return  to  this  world.</p>
<p>The  qi  harvest  fruit  started  to  tremble  as  a  grand  aura  leaked  out,  creating   huge  qi  waves.</p>
<p>The  entrance  of  Heavenly  Court  opened  as  this  aura  was  exposed  to  the   outside  world.</p>
<p>At  once,  within  spectral  heaven,  qi  currents  either  fell,  moved  together  like   a  storm,  or  even  created  all  sorts  of  vortexes  and  whirlpools.</p>
<p>A  peculiar  phenomenon  was  formed  as  the  five  regions  went  into  an  uproar!</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival  was  almost  completed.</p>
<p>Finally,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  let  out  a  sigh  of  relief  and   knelt  on  one  knee  as  she  said:  ”This  disciple  pays  respects  to  master.”</p>
<p>Within  Northern  Plains,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  sighed,  the  outcome   was  decided.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan,  however,  stared  at  Heavenly  Court.  He  frowned  with  a  vague   hint  of  anticipation  and  excitement  in  his  eyes.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment.</p>
<p>Boom!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  —  exploded!</p>
<p>In  Northern  Plains,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  stood  on  the  spot,  he   looked  in  the  direction  of  Heavenly  Court  with  uncontrollable  shock  on  his   face.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  Fang  Yuan  had  a  faint  smile.</p>
