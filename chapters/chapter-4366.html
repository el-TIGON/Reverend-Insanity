        <p>:  Heavenly  Ghost  Concealment</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  killer  move  was  called  chaotic   intent  dispels  dream.</p>
<p>It  was  a  wisdom  path  killer  move  but  included  a  large  number  of  dream   path  mortal  Gu  to  imitate  the  power  of  dream  path,  it  could  influence  dream   realms.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  deduced  this  move  to  counter  Fang   Yuan’s  dream  realm  methods.</p>
<p>In  the  past,  Fang  Yuan  had  self-detonated  Pure  Dream  Reality  Seeker   bodies  to  create  dream  realms  in  battles,  and  with  most  methods  in  the   world  being  ineffective  against  dream  realms,  Fang  Yuan  was  able  to   succeed  time  and  again.</p>
<p>Afterwards,  when  Fang  Yuan  wanted  to  collect  these  dream  realms,  he   would  use  pure  dream  reality  seeker  transformation  killer  move  to   transform  the  dream  realms  into  clones  and  take  them  away.</p>
<p>But  this  situation  could  not  happen  after  chaotic  intent  dispels  dream  killer   move  was  used.</p>
<p>The  dream  path  mortal  Gu  in  chaotic  intent  dispels  dream  only  had  the   function  of  a  key,  the  true  method  was  still  wisdom  path.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  used  the  wisdom  path  method  to   disturb  the  will  and  emotions  contained  in  the  dream  realm  to  make  them</p>
<p>chaotic.</p>
<p>Whether  it  be  the  human  path  dream  realms  or  heaven  path  dream  realms,   they  contained  human  wills  and  emotions,  or  heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>When  these  wills  and  emotions  turn  chaotic,  dream  realms—especially  the   orderly  dream  realms—would  lose  their  order  and  turn  chaotic.  The  Gu   cultivator  who  was  exploring  the  dream  realm  would  be  met  with  calamity   like  a  fish  that  entered  water  which  had  started  to  boil.</p>
<p>Once  the  Pure  Dream  Reality  Seeker  Physique  bodies  were  struck  by  this   move,  their  stable  human  bodies  would  turn  back  into  dream  realms.  Their   human  wills,  emotions,  and  so  on  would  turn  disorderly  along  with  the   dream  realms  and  be  unable  to  think.</p>
<p>Meng  Qiu  Zhen  who  entered  with  his  body  and  soul  would  be  torn  into   pieces  by  the  chaotic  dream  realm  as  time  passed.</p>
<p>Fortunately,  Fang  Yuan  stopped  this  in  time,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  was  forced  to  stop  the  move  which  allowed  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  to   escape  disaster.</p>
<p>As  for  the  efforts  in  remodeling  the  dream  realm  blessed  land  turning  to   waste,  they  were  already  minor  details.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  flew  back  while  avoiding  Fang   Yuan’s  attacks  and  observing  the  heaven  path  dream  realm.</p>
<p>When  she  saw  the  heaven  path  dream  realm  that  swallowed  Meng  Qiu  Zhen   returning  to  its  previous  self  and  not  having  any  other  abnormal  changes,   she  knew  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  was  still  alive.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  sighed  inwardly.</p>
<p>Deducing  this  chaotic  intent  dispels  dream  was  already  the  limit  of  her   ability.</p>
<p>It  was  because  dream  path  restricted  her.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  almost  a  blank  slate  in  dream   path,  she  also  did  not  have  any  dream  path  Immortal  Gu  and  had  to  use  a   large  number  of  dream  path  mortal  Gu  as  replacement.  She  fully  relied  on   her  terrifying  wisdom  path  foundation  to  raise  the  killer  move  to  rank  eight   level!</p>
<p>She  wanted  to  do  more  but  she  was  powerless.</p>
<p>This  was  the  reason  she  could  not  save  Fairy  Zi  Wei  and  Ying  Wu  Xie  who   were  trapped  in  heaven  path  dream  realms.  At  most,  she  could  use  this   killer  move  to  kill  them.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  needed  a  living  Spectral  Soul   clone,  there  was  no  meaning  in  killing  him.</p>
<p>She,  however,  wanted  to  kill  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>But  chaotic  intent  dispels  dream’s  activation  needed  to  be  maintained,  if  she   was  disturbed  by  Fang  Yuan  in  this  process,  she  would  suffer  a  backlash   which  was  dangerous.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  attacked  intensely,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   method  made  him  anxious.  He  could  only  observe  closely  and  not  give  her   any  chance  to  continue  activating  the  killer  move.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  attacked  crazily  from  the  side.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  attention  was  mainly  on  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   so  he  could  only  try  to  dodge  Giant  Sun’s  attacks.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  aggressive  and  had  plenty  of  battle   experience,  most  of  his  attacks  still  landed  on  Fang  Yuan’s  body.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  reverse  flow  protection  seal  but  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable’s  lingering  scrap  luck  was  too  troublesome  so  he  canceled  the   move  and  relied  on  heavenly  web  protection  veil  to  defend  himself.</p>
<p>This  was  a  genuine  rank  nine  killer  move  with  the  amplification  of  Fang   Yuan’s  heaven  path  dao  marks,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  attacks  did   not  achieve  anything.</p>
<p>No  matter  how  mysterious  and  ingenious  or  grand  and  majestic  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable’s  attacks  were,  they  were  treated  as  non-existent  when   they  struck  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>“What  kind  of  defensive  method  is  this?!”  The  more  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  fought,  the  more  shaken  he  was.  Even  his  face  started  to  shake.</p>
<p>The  tighter  Fang  Yuan’s  defense  was,  the  more  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  wanted  to  see  through  him.  But  obscured  heavenly  secret  had   merged  with  heavenly  web  protection  veil,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s   investigative  methods  were  all  thwarted  by  obscured  heavenly  secret.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  could  not  see  through  him,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  the  same.</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  felt  increasingly  suspicious.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  defending  against  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   while  transmitting  his  voice  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  to  help  him   and  attack  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  emphasizing  on   Heavenly  Court’s  strength.</p>
<p>Moreover,  he  promised  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  that  if  he  did  this,  he   would  innovate  even  more  blood  path  Immortal  Gu  and  blood  path  research   results,  he  would  give  them  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  immediately  felt  much  better,  if  Fang  Yuan   was  making  such  a  big  concession,  it  meant  he  probably  could  not  hold  on   for  long.</p>
<p>But  his  attacks  became  even  stronger  as  he  transmitted  his  voice:  ”Fang   Yuan,  you  are  too  modest,  you  are  probably  the  strongest  among  us  three   venerables  currently!  Not  to  mention  anything  else,  just  your  defensive   method  actually  made  us  helpless.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  quickly  said:  ”This  killer  move  uses  secluded  domain  of  heaven   and  earth—City  Well—as  the  core,  Giant  Sun,  you  have  no  rank  nine  killer   move  currently,  how  can  you  break  it?  Since  you  can’t  break  it,  why  make   things  difficult  for  me  and  let  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  obtain   the  biggest  benefits?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  slowed  down  his  attacks.</p>
<p>In  his  mind,  he  thought:  ’Fang  Yuan  is  doing  his  best  to  convince  me  and   speaking  so  submissively,  he  may  really  be  at  his  limit.  He  has  the  least   immortal  essence,  his  killer  moves  are  so  terrifying,  how  can  they  not   expend  a  lot  of  immortal  essence?’</p>
<p>‘I  will  slow  down  my  attacks  and  let  him  catch  a  breather  so  he  can   continue  this  battle  of  attrition  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable!’</p>
<p>‘As  for  the  heaven  path  dream  realms,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  almost  succeeded  just  earlier.  How  can  Fang  Yuan  absorb  so   many  heaven  path  dream  realms  in  a  short  time?’</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  saw  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   slowing  his  attacks,  she  immediately  had  a  bad  feeling  and  inwardly  cursed   Giant  Sun  while  transmitting  her  voice  to  him.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  told  Giant  Sun  that  attainment  levels   were  the  most  difficult  to  progress  in,  since  Fang  Yuan  was  so  determined   on  developing  in  heaven  path,  these  heaven  path  dreams  were  of  huge  help   to  him.  How  could  they  watch  as  he  succeeds?</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  made  a  perfunctory  reply.</p>
<p>The  fight  of  the  three  venerables  continued  in  a  stalemate,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  continued  to  persuade:  ”Giant  Sun,  look   at  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable.  His  situation  is  the  worst  but  is</p>
<p>already  fighting  me  to  a  draw.  What  will  happen  if  he  has  enough  immortal   essence  in  the  future?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  sighed  as  he  replied:  ”What  you  say  makes   sense.  But…”</p>
<p>He  sighed  again  as  he  hesitated  to  speak.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  eyelids  twitched  slightly,  she  knew   she  had  to  give  benefits  to  make  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  take  action.</p>
<p>She  did  not  hesitate  as  she  immediately  handed  many  blood  path  research   results  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  through  treasure  yellow  heaven.</p>
<p>After  obtaining  the  benefits,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  attacked  Fang   Yuan  madly  once  again.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  sighed  inwardly.</p>
<p>He  knew  that  the  strength  he  exposed  had  already  touched  the  bottom-line   of  the  two  venerables.  If  he  crossed  it  by  even  a  little,  the  two  venerables   would  ally  even  more  closely.</p>
<p>This  would  incur  an  unfavorable  loss.</p>
<p>Immediately,  Fang  Yuan  shouted  loudly:  ”You  guys  forced  me!”</p>
<p>The  moment  he  finished  speaking,  he  activated  a  killer  move,  turning  into  a   spiral  light  rainbow  that  zoomed  past  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  were  stunned  before  their  expressions  changed.  They   understood  Fang  Yuan’s  evil  intention  as  they  quickly  used  their  methods  to   obstruct  the  spiral  rainbow.</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  lacked  tacit  coordination,  they  attacked  at  the  same   time  which  instead  left  Fang  Yuan  unharmed.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  receive  any  attacks.  He  immediately  retreated  and  pulled   apart  some  distance  from  the  two  venerables  before  using  a  killer  move  to   fly  out  of  the  battlefield.</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  could  only  try  to  obstruct  him  again.</p>
<p>This  time,  they  communicated  with  each  other  and  there  was  no  loophole   like  before.</p>
<p>But  like  this,  Fang  Yuan  had  the  initiative  instead.</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  felt  stifled  as  Fang  Yuan  was  headed  towards  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>In  the  fight  of  the  three  venerables,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s   inactivity  was  a  good  thing  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.  Fang  Yuan  had  evil  intentions,  he   wanted  to  anger  this  venerable  and  bring  him  over  to  create  chaos  while  he   looked  to  gain  benefits.</p>
<p>The  confrontation  lasted  for  a  while  but  the  two  venerables  could  not  stop   him  every  time,  eventually,  Fang  Yuan  managed  to  hit  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  had  lost  his  rationality,  he  was  a  venerable   but  was  closer  to  being  a  soul  beast.</p>
<p>After  being  angered,  he  immediately  charged  into  the  battlefield  of  the  three   venerables.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   could  only  helplessly  face  him.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  did  not  care  who  was  who,  anyone  that  was   before  him  needed  to  be  dealt  with!</p>
<p>Over  this  period,  his  strength  had  increased  by  a  lot  and  was  no  longer  in   the  previously  weak  state.  The  three  venerables  needed  to  be  much  more   careful  than  before  when  fighting  Spectral  Soul.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul’s  attacks  were  grand  and  ferocious,  he  even  activated  killer   moves  from  time  to  time.</p>
<p>The  three  venerables  did  not  want  to  provoke  this  lunatic.  They  had  to  fight   each  other  as  well;  in  short,  the  situation  was  extremely  chaotic.</p>
<p>The  chaotic  battlefield  was  the  most  beneficial  to  Fang  Yuan  as  he  could   finally  take  a  breather.  If  the  previous  situation  continued,  his  obscured   heavenly  secret  would  not  have  been  able  to  last  for  long.</p>
<p>Immediately,  he  took  advantage  of  the  chaos  to  activate  obscured  heavenly   secret  twice  on  himself  without  leaking  even  a  trace  of  their  aura.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  kept  on  planning  and  finally  grasped   the  chance,  luring  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  into  the  group  of  heaven   path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>But  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  did  not  do  anything  to  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable,  thwarting  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  plan.</p>
<p>The  four  venerables  fought  amidst  the  heaven  path  dream  realms,  as  long  as   it  was  not  a  dream  path  killer  move,  even  venerable  killer  moves  could  not   harm  the  heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>The  heaven  path  dream  realms  did  not  attack  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  but  attacked  the  other  three  venerables.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  joined  hands  to  attack  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  needed  to  attack  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and   continue  pressuring  her  to  stop  her  from  harming  his  clone  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.</p>
<p>As  for  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  he  attacked  no  matter  who  it  was.   The  heaven  path  dream  realms  were  not  an  exception,  but  his  attacks  were   ineffective  on  them.</p>
<p>This  chaotic  scene  lasted  for  fifteen  minutes,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  gradually  gained  an  upper  hand.</p>
<p>She  was  a  wisdom  path  Gu  Immortal  who  was  proficient  in  planning,  a   chaotic  situation  meant  she  had  much  more  factors  to  calculate.  When  she   started  adapting  and  was  clear  of  various  factors,  she  could  make  use  of  the   surrounding  environment  easily.</p>
<p>Discovering  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  repeatedly  used   the  surrounding  heaven  path  dream  realms,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,   or  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  to  stop  him,  Fang  Yuan  knew  it  was  time   to  use  another  trump  card.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Heavenly  Ghost  Concealment!</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  directly  ignored  Fang   Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  openly  moved  past  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  countless   hands  and  reached  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>A  fierce  killer  move  dealt  a  huge  blow  to  the  unprepared  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan,  you…”</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan,  impressive,  so  that  was  it.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  and  Giant  Sun  were  shaken.</p>
