        <p>:  Three  Venerables  Attack  Heavenly  Court!</p>
<p>“One  step  more,  just  one  small  step!”  Duke  Mei  shouted  in  his  heart.</p>
<p>He  was  surrounded  by  surging  white  qi,  the  qi  path  dao  marks  were  so   dense  that  the  Heavenly  Court  expert  Duke  Mei  could  barely  move  a  single   step!</p>
<p>He  had  to  use  all  his  effort  to  move  forward  by  a  small  step.</p>
<p>The  immortal  essence  expenditure  was  huge,  Duke  Mei  not  only  had  to   resist  the  pressure  of  the  white  qi,  he  also  had  to  block  the  corrosion  of  the   qi  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>“Senior  Duke  Mei,  I’ll  take  over!”  A  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortal  shouted   from  behind.</p>
<p>Duke  Mei  gritted  his  teeth  but  he  still  made  a  small  advancement  of  a  tiny   step  before  stopping  and  fixing  his  position  desperately.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortal  behind  quickly  used  a  killer  move  to  get   around  Duke  Mei  and  become  the  new  vanguard  of  the  group.</p>
<p>By  the  time  this  group  reached  the  original  location  of  the  qi  harvest  fruit,   they  found  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Her  clothes  were  messy  and  her  hair  was  disheveled,  there  was  blood   flowing  out  of  her  lips  and  eyes,  she  seemed  to  be  in  a  daze?</p>
<p>Duke  Mei  and  the  rest  were  shocked,  they  had  never  seen  such  an   expression  on  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  face.</p>
<p>“Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable!”  Duke  Mei  shouted  and  used   an  immortal  method  to  transmit  to  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  shook  as  she  showed  a  reaction.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  starlight  burst  out  and  suppressed  the  surrounding   white  qi  with  ease.</p>
<p>Duke  Mei  and  the  rest  immediately  felt  the  pressure  lifting  off  their  bodies,   it  was  as  if  a  mountain  had  been  lifted  away  from  their  backs.</p>
<p>Starlight  continued  to  sweep  through  the  white  qi,  after  a  few  breaths  of   time,  the  white  qi  rampaging  in  Heavenly  Court  were  all  suppressed  by  the   starlight!</p>
<p>“This  is  the  might  of  a  venerable!”  Duke  Mei  and  the  rest  saw  this  as  they   felt  internally  shaken.</p>
<p>“When  the  explosion  occurred,  I  remember  seeing  a  rapidly  rising  star  veil   that  protected  us.  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  must  have  taken   action  to  block  most  of  the  force  of  this  explosion.”  Several  immortals   recalled.</p>
<p>Next,  they  stared  with  wide  eyes  as  they  saw  the  human  shaped  qi  harvest   fruit  core.</p>
<p>Although  the  qi  harvest  fruit  exploded,  the  core  was  still  around!</p>
<p>However,  despite  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core  having  a  human  shape,  it  was  no   longer  as  lively  as  before,  it  was  blurry  and  unstable,  with  qi  path  dao   marks  leaking  out  at  all  times.</p>
<p>The  white  qi  that  covered  Heavenly  Court  were  produced  by  the  leaking  qi   path  dao  marks  of  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core.</p>
<p>Right  now,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  displayed  the  power  of  a   venerable  and  forcefully  pushed  these  qi  path  dao  marks  back  into  the  qi   harvest  fruit.</p>
<p>Because  of  this,  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core  stabilized,  its  appearance  became   clearer  again.</p>
<p>“We  still  have  a  chance!”</p>
<p>“Yes,  we  can  still  revive  Lord  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable!!”</p>
<p>After  noticing  this,  Duke  Mei  and  the  rest  were  excited.</p>
<p>In  just  a  short  period,  starlight  gathered  and  turned  into  a  soft  stardust  cloth,   it  wrapped  around  the  human  shaped  qi  harvest  fruit  core  like  a  bandage.</p>
<p>After  a  few  breaths  of  time,  there  was  over  a  hundred  layers  of  bandage,  the   core  could  no  longer  be  seen.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  let  out  a  breath  of  air  as  she  stopped   the  killer  move.</p>
<p>Drip  drop.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  blood  flowed  out  of  her  nose.</p>
<p>The  bleeding  did  not  stop,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  face   turned  increasingly  pale.</p>
<p>When  the  qi  harvest  fruit  exploded,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   activated  several  killer  moves.</p>
<p>The  advantage  of  wisdom  path  was  an  abundance  of  thoughts  to  allow  the   user  to  use  more  complex  killer  moves.</p>
<p>Just  by  looking  at  this,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  truly  the   number  one  person  in  wisdom  path,  her  status  could  not  be  threatened  by</p>
<p>anyone.</p>
<p>On  one  hand,  she  protected  herself  and  the  other  Gu  Immortals  to  ensure   their  safety,  on  the  other  hand,  she  directly  suppressed  the  qi  harvest  fruit   core.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  blocked  most  of  the  force  of  the   explosion,  otherwise,  Heavenly  Court’s  Gu  Immortals  would  have  all   perished.</p>
<p>And  most  importantly,  she  retained  some  hope.</p>
<p>Without  her,  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core  would  have  exploded,  Primordial   Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival  would  have  failed  completely.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Luck  Slicing  Golden  Blade!</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  chased  after  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  she  shot  out  a   small  golden  blade.</p>
<p>The  golden  blade  was  only  the  size  of  a  thumb,  it  flew  into  the  air  and  grew   larger  as  it  moved,  quickly  reaching  the  size  of  a  horse  carriage.</p>
<p>Swish  swish  swish.</p>
<p>The  golden  blade  swung  down,  in  an  attempt  to  slice  off  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable’s  luck.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  ignored  the  attack,  he  only  focused  on   entering  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>The  horse  carriage-sized  golden  blade  danced  above  his  head,  it  was  simply   like  an  ant  compared  to  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  colossal  black   mountain-like  body.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  massive  luck  was  reduced  by  the  luck   slicing  golden  blade.</p>
<p>Of  course,  the  effect  was  insignificant  compared  to  the  sheer  size  of  his   luck!</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  felt  a  sense  of  helplessness.</p>
<p>Che  Wei,  Red  Heart  Traveler,  and  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  all  had  the  same   feeling.</p>
<p>Despite  Demon  Judgment  Board  shooting  out  beams  of  blood-red  light   continuously,  it  only  managed  to  fracture  a  few  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable’s  arms,  in  just  a  few  breaths  of  time,  they  recovered  completely.</p>
<p>The  difference  between  rank  nine  and  eight  was  too  massive,  even  with  the   full  strength  of  Qin  Ding  Ling  and  the  others,  they  could  not  affect  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>After  the  huge  massacre,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  had  already   recovered  by  a  large  extent.</p>
<p>During  normal  times,  if  Qin  Ding  Ling  and  the  rest  provoked  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable  like  this,  he  would  definitely  attack  them.  But  now,   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  only  goal  was  Heavenly  Court!</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  filled  with  heaven’s  will,  he  had  once   devoured  black  heaven’s  heavenly  spirit,  so  after  the  two  heavens  fused,  he   became  the  ruler  of  spectral  heaven.</p>
<p>Before  that,  he  had  destroyed  the  heavenly  chasm,  heavenly  pillars,  and  the   various  white  heaven  grotto-heavens  (like  Flickering  Light  grotto-heaven),   he  even  went  as  far  as  to  destroy  the  sun,  it  was  all  to  unify  the  two   heavens.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  was  a  grotto-heaven  situated  in  immemorial  white  heaven,   it  had  also  annexed  countless  nine  heavens  fragments  in  the  past,  it  was  the   greatest  tumor  in  the  immemorial  nine  heavens  in  the  first  place.</p>
<p>The  existence  of  Heavenly  Court  itself  was  the  greatest  provocation  to   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  he  would  not  allow  its  existence!</p>
<p>Rumble…</p>
<p>With  a  loud  rumble,  the  mountain-like  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable   created  a  huge  gap  and  broke  into  Heavenly  Court  by  force.</p>
<p>The  whole  of  Heavenly  Court  was  shaking!</p>
<p>The  Central  Continent  Gu  Immortals  who  were  still  in  Heavenly  Court   looked  up  and  saw  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  colossal  body,  they  all   gasped  in  shock.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  flying  above  them  now,  he  cast  a  huge   shadow  on  everyone.</p>
<p>Thousands  or  even  tens  of  thousands  of  arms  formed  a  terrifying  forest  of   limbs,  they  were  raised  up  or  lowered,  some  were  tucked  in  while  others   were  straight,  it  showed  the  stance  of  grasping  the  sun  and  moon,  it  had  the   potential  to  catch  stars  and  whip  up  storms.</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  and  the  rest  chased  him  from  behind  like  tiny  mosquitoes.   Even  the  rank  eight  Immortal  Gu  House  Demon  Judgment  Board  was   merely  a  mouse  in  front  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>Roar—!</p>
<p>One  of  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  three  heads  started  to  roar.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Soul  Howl!</p>
<p>He  used  a  soul  path  killer  move,  boundless  sound  waves  started  to  spread.</p>
<p>Wherever  the  sound  waves  reached,  a  tornado  blew  the  tiles  of  Heavenly   Court  away.  Zhao  Lian  Yun  and  others  felt  like  a  disaster  was  approaching,   many  of  them  quickly  took  out  their  Immortal  Gu  Houses.</p>
<p>At  once,  there  was  a  display  of  Immortal  Gu  Houses.</p>
<p>Scattered  Stars  Camp,  Thin  Willow  Camp,  Wind  Sweeping  Building,  Cloud   Passing  Building,  Sun  and  Moon  Temple,  Spirit  Affinity  House,  Myriad   Dragon  Dock,  Heaven’s  Envy  Manor,  Ancient  Soul  Sect,  Heavenly  Pool,   Illusion  Garden,  Canary  Pavilion,  Yue  Yang  Palace,  Immortal  Crane  Sect…</p>
<p>Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects  all  had  their  own  Immortal  Gu   Houses  to  defend  them,  their  respective  names  were  derived  from  their   strongest  Immortal  Gu  Houses[1.  Sect  in  these  names  also  is  read  as  gate   which  refers  to  the  Gu  Houses  being  buildings  with  large  gates.].</p>
<p>Among  them,  Heavenly  Lotus  Sect  was  the  most  unique  one,  because  it  was   created  by  Genesis  Lotus  Immortal  Venerable,  it  had  a  total  of  five   Immortal  Gu  Houses,  the  highest  among  the  ten  ancient  sects.</p>
<p>When  the  Immortal  Gu  Houses  were  not  in  use  normally,  the  respective   sects’  first  supreme  elders  would  keep  them  inside  their  immortal  apertures.   If  the  first  supreme  elders  were  unavailable,  other  authoritative  experts   would  undertake  the  responsibility.</p>
<p>These  people  had  all  basically  survived.</p>
<p>Immortal  Gu  Houses  of  all  shapes  and  sizes  shook  intensely  from  the  huge   impact  of  the  soul  howl  sound  waves,  they  were  like  ships  in  a  storm,  about   to  capsize  at  any  moment.</p>
<p>Within  some  of  the  Immortal  Gu  Houses,  low  growling  noises  could  be   heard  from  the  Gu  Immortals.  These  Immortal  Gu  Houses  had  weak   defenses  against  soul  path.</p>
<p>Boom  boom  boom.</p>
<p>With  a  series  of  explosions,  several  Gu  Immortals’  souls  exploded  from  the   force  of  the  sound  waves,  dying  on  the  spot.</p>
<p>These  Central  Continent  Gu  Immortals  were  not  in  their  peak  condition,   they  were  all  injured.  Some  of  the  ones  with  severe  injuries  survived  the   earlier  explosion  but  could  not  endure  the  soul  howl,  they  lost  their  lives.</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  and  the  rest  were  wavering  in  the  air,  being  on  the  brink  of   life  and  death.</p>
<p>They  had  suffered  huge  injuries  to  begin  with,  they  had  even  taken  a  risk   earlier  to  quickly  destroy  Fang  Yuan’s  totem  killer  moves,  it  was  already  a   miracle  that  they  were  still  alive  now!</p>
<p>At  the  moment  of  crisis,  starlight  shone  brightly  like  the  boundless  sea,   pressing  towards  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>The  soul  howl  stopped  at  once,  it  was  like  someone  was  strangling  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>“Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  don’t  be  too  brazen.”  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  had  a  cold  expression  as  she  flew  towards  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  opened  his  mouth  as  black  smoke  gathered,   he  spat  out  a  grand  soul  river.</p>
<p>There  were  countless  vengeful  souls  in  the  soul  river,  they  flowed  towards   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  his  countless  arms  grabbed  towards  her,  many  monstrous   claws  gathered  to  firm  sharp  spear  tips  that  pierced  the  air,  the  attack  was   fast  and  brutal,  shocking  deities  and  devils!</p>
<p>The  starlight  only  suppressed  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  for  a  few   breaths  of  time  before  breaking  apart.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  dodge,  she  snorted   coldly  as  star  fog  appeared,  permeating  the  black  smoke  that  quickly   dissipated,  while  the  fog  continued  to  break  apart  the  soul  river.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  claws  extended  into  the  star  fog  but  failed   to  catch  anything.</p>
<p>Even  though  he  grabbed  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  the  latter   shattered  like  a  star  illusion.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  did  not  give  up,  he  continued  to  rampage  in   the  star  fog  and  growled  continuously,  echoing  in  the  whole  of  Heavenly   Court.</p>
<p>Qin  Ding  Ling  and  the  rest  quickly  landed  on  the  ground,  they  hid   themselves  in  the  Immortal  Gu  Houses  and  used  their  time  to  heal.</p>
<p>Zhao  Lian  Yun  and  the  other  Central  Continent  Gu  Immortals  watched  with   palpitating  hearts.</p>
<p>The  battle  of  two  venerables  was  too  ferocious.  The  aftermath  of  any  single   move  could  topple  Immortal  Gu  Houses  and  cause  many  Gu  Immortals   inside  to  die.</p>
<p>Thankfully,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  been  suppressing   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  during  the  entire  fight,  she  held  firm   control  over  the  situation.</p>
<p>“This  is  the  might  of  a  Dao  Lord!”</p>
<p>“Heavenly  Court  is  still  around,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  has   a  huge  amplification  when  she  fights  in  here,  thus,  she  can  easily  suppress   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.”</p>
<p>“Of  course,  the  crucial  factor  is  that  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  has   lost  his  sanity.”</p>
<p>“Unless  the  rank  nine  fire  Gu  in  his  body  activates,  he  will  not  break  out  of   this  predicament.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  watched  from  afar  and  contacted  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun,  what  are  you  hesitating  for?”</p>
<p>“Primordial  Origin’s  revival  had  a  hitch,  but  hope  remains.  Right  now,  we   must  join  hands  and  work  with  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  to  destroy   Heavenly  Court,  it  is  our  best  chance!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  hesitated:  ”We  should  observe  further.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  snorted  coldly:  ”If  you  still  want  to  stall  for  time,  you  must  have   allied  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  secretly.  In  that  case,  I   won’t  be  able  to  stop  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  revival.  I  will   fight  my  way  into  Northern  Plains  and  slaughter  all  the  Huang  Jin  tribes.”</p>
<p>“You  dare?!”</p>
<p>“Why  won’t  I?  You  have  Longevity  Heaven  while  Star  Constellation  has   Heavenly  Court.  If  you  want  to  drive  me  to  desperation,  will  I  just  give  up   and  die?  I  will  not  let  either  of  you  off!”  Fang  Yuan  gritted  his  teeth,   showing  a  look  of  insanity  and  desperation.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly:  ”Fine,  I’ll  ally  with  you,  we   must  destroy  the  qi  harvest  fruit  core!”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  let  out  a  breath  of  air,  praising:  ”This  is  a  wise  choice,  please  act   quickly,  I’ll  wait  for  you  to  enter  the  battlefield.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  gritted  his  teeth  and  set  off  from  Northern   Plains.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  calm  and  composed,  he  slowly  rose  into  spectral  heaven   from  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>“Oh  no,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Heaven  Refining  Demon   Venerable  are  approaching  Heavenly  Court!”  Within  Heaven  Overseeing   Tower,  a  Gu  Immortal  spoke  with  a  trembling  voice,  transmitting  the   information.</p>
