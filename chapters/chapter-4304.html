    <h1>Chapter  2282</h1>
    <p>:  Implicating  The  World</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  destroyed  the  sun,  while  the  three  venerables’  fight  started   and  ended  abruptly.</p>
<p>The  impact  of  this  battle  was  quickly  spreading  throughout  the  five  regions.</p>
<p>Southern  Border.</p>
<p>“What  a  large  lump  of  tap  fire.”  Rank  four  Gu  Master  Xiao  Yan  did  his  best   to  dodge.</p>
<p>The  lump  of  orange  flame  approached  him  like  a  rolling  stone,  it  was  large   as  an  elephant,  attempting  to  devour  him.</p>
<p>Right  when  Xiao  Yan  was  about  to  make  a  move  and  capture  this  tap  fire,  a   Gu  Master  suddenly  made  an  attack!</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>With  a  loud  sound,  Xiao  Yan  was  set  flying  far  away.</p>
<p>“Who  are  you?  This  is  Shang  clan’s  territory!”  Xiao  Yan  shouted,  not  only   did  he  fail  to  get  the  tap  fire,  he  even  suffered  injuries.</p>
<p>“Hehehe,  are  you  proud  of  being  a  lackey  of  Shang  clan?”  From  the   shadows,  a  demonic  path  Gu  Master  walked  out.</p>
<p>He  had  rank  four  cultivation  level  too.</p>
<p>Xiao  Yan’s  pupils  shrunk:  ”So  it  is  you,  Fiery  Star  Bao  Tong!”</p>
<p>He  immediately  understood  why  Bao  Tong  attacked  him,  the  other  party   was  also  a  fire  path  cultivator,  he  must  be  after  this  tap  fire.</p>
<p>Boom  boom  boom!</p>
<p>The  two  engaged  in  an  intense  battle,  sparks  flew  everywhere  as  explosions   resounded.</p>
<p>Initially,  both  sides  were  evenly  matched,  but  soon,  Xiao  Yan  gained  an   upper  hand.</p>
<p>Bao  Tong  became  more  furious  as  he  fought,  Xiao  Yan  was  a  junior  but  he   was  actually  fighting  on  an  even  level,  in  fact,  he  was  even  slightly   stronger.</p>
<p>This  was  the  benefit  of  having  a  large  force  behind  you.</p>
<p>A  moment  later,  Bao  Tong  fell  back  while  spitting  blood,  he  held  his  chest   and  the  unsightly  expression  on  his  face  that  was  covered  in  soot  could  not   be  concealed:  ”So  the  rumors  are  not  wrong,  you  actually  have  so  many   rank  four  Gu.  You  must  be  the  subordinate  who  climbed  into  Shang  clan   leader  Shang  Xin  Ci’s  bed?”</p>
<p>Xiao  Yan  was  instantly  enraged:  ”Scoundrel,  you  dare  to  slander  my  clan   leader!”</p>
<p>Xiao  Yan  had  wanted  to  let  Bao  Tong  off  earlier  instead  of  chasing  after   him,  but  now,  he  attacked  Bao  Tong  with  intense  rage.</p>
<p>Bao  Tong  cried  out  in  dismay  internally,  against  Xiao  Yan’s  furious  attacks,   he  had  to  retreat  constantly  and  quickly  fell  into  danger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  at  a  dark  corner,  there  was  a  Gu  Master  quietly  observing  this   battle.</p>
<p>This  Gu  Master  had  rank  five  cultivation  level,  his  face  and  body  were   unclear,  covered  by  dense  fog.</p>
<p>“Shang  Xin  Ci…”  The  rank  five  Gu  Master  gritted  his  teeth,  it  was  clear   that  he  had  huge  grudges  with  her.</p>
<p>A  will  was  located  in  his  mind:  ”Little  Tian,  don’t  be  rash.  Shang  Xin  Ci  is   a  Gu  Immortal  seed  of  Shang  clan,  you  have  only  just  managed  to  escape   and  change  your  identity.  Now,  you  need  to  hide  yourself  and  cultivate   seriously.  You  need  to  transcend  the  limits  of  a  mortal  and  become  a  rank   six  qi  path  Gu  Immortal!”</p>
<p>The  rank  five  Gu  Master  was  Kong  Ri  Tian,  while  the  will  in  his  mind  was   Kong  Sheng  Tian.</p>
<p>Back  then,  when  Kong  Sheng  Tian  obtained  Sheng  Tian  true  inheritance,   Wu  Ji,  Shang  Xin  Ci,  and  the  rest  came  to  fight  over  it.  He  swore  to  take   revenge!</p>
<p>Kong  Ri  Tian  gritted  his  teeth:  ”But  ancestor,  I  already  have  confidence  in   ascending.  But  you  told  me  not  to  do  it  because  I  should  not  miss  the   opportunity  for  natural  inspiration?”</p>
<p>Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  explained:  ”Spectral  Soul  destroyed  the  sun,  he  also   got  rid  of  many  heaven  vein  nodes  in  white  heaven,  like  heavenly  chasms,   heavenly  pillars  and  others.  Immemorial  white  heaven  will  soon  be   devoured  by  immemorial  black  heaven,  the  fusion  of  both  heavens  will  not   last  long,  along  with  the  disturbance  of  heaven’s  will.  Once  heaven’s  will   stabilizes,  you  will  undergo  immortal  ascension.”</p>
<p>“So  that’s  it,  I  can’t  wait.”  Kong  Ri  Tian  chuckled.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  he  attacked!</p>
<p>“Since  I  can’t  take  revenge  on  Shang  Xin  Ci,  I  will  target  her  subordinates,   I  will  kill  her  sweetheart  Xiao  Yan  first  and  let  her  experience  some  pain.”   Killing  intent  surged  in  Kong  Ri  Tian’s  mind.</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>“Don’t  worry,  after  I  kill  Xiao  Yan,  I  will  frame  it  on  Bao  Tong!  I  am   familiar  with  this.”  Kong  Ri  Tian  secretly  moved  towards  Xiao  Yan,   because  the  latter  was  focused  on  Bao  Tong,  he  did  not  sense  anything.</p>
<p>“Sigh…  you  need  to  settle  this  quickly!”  Kong  Sheng  Tian’s  will  sighed   helplessly.</p>
<p>That  night.</p>
<p>Golden  flames  burned  the  entire  mountain,  countless  lifeforms  perished  in   the  sea  of  fire.</p>
<p>The  light  of  the  fire  illuminated  the  sky,  because  it  was  near  Shang  Liang   Mountain,  Shang  Xin  Ci  quickly  detected  it.</p>
<p>“Oh  no,  something  happened  to  Xiao  Yan,  just  the  tap  fire  alone  cannot   produce  such  power!”  Shang  Xin  Ci’s  heart  sank,  she  could  not  help  but   feel  worried  about  Xiao  Yan.</p>
<p>Even  though  she  only  had  rank  five  cultivation  level,  she  had  abundant   knowledge  and  knew  that  this  was  an  immortal  material  flame  just  by   looking  at  the  light.</p>
<p>Shang  Xin  Ci  did  not  send  any  reinforcements  to  help  Xiao  Yan,  because   this  involved  immortal  materials,  it  was  not  a  mortal  matter,  Shang  clan’s   Gu  Immortals  had  to  resolve  it.</p>
<p>Shang  Xin  Ci  looked  at  the  sky.</p>
<p>Without  the  sun,  the  sky  was  pitch  black.</p>
<p>This  beautiful  and  kind  woman  sighed  deeply  as  she  showed  a  look  of   worry.</p>
<p>“I  wonder  how  many  people  are  suffering  and  in  pain  right  now?  Even  as   Shang  clan  leader,  I  am  still  too  weak.”</p>
<p>The  changes  in  heaven  and  earth  shook  everyone’s  hearts.</p>
<p>In  Southern  Border’s  Gu  Master  world,  the  demonic  path  had  gotten  quite   rampant  for  a  certain  period.  Shang  Xin  Ci  did  her  best  to  salvage  the   situation  but  against  calamities  and  natural  disasters,  her  effort  amounted  to   futility.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>White  crane  sea  area.</p>
<p>Nan  Gong  Yuan  was  gathering  the  crane  group.</p>
<p>Far  away  in  the  horizon,  vast  and  grand  frost  energy  swept  over  and  caused   the  surrounding  temperature  to  fall.</p>
<p>White  crane  sea  area  was  originally  owned  by  Eastern  Sea’s  lone  immortal   Qin  Bai  He.</p>
<p>After  Qin  Bai  He  was  killed  by  Fang  Yuan,  white  crane  sea  area  was  taken   by  the  closest  super  force,  Nan  Gong  clan.</p>
<p>Nan  Gong  clan  invested  a  batch  of  resources  and  created  the  formation,   they  wanted  to  develop  this  place,  but  to  think  that  the  sun  was  destroyed  by   Spectral  Soul.</p>
<p>Once  the  sun  was  destroyed,  the  temperature  of  the  five  regions  fell  sharply,   because  white  crane  sea  area  was  right  beside  icy  sea  area,  it  was  quite   badly  affected.</p>
<p>Recently,  icy  sea  area  had  already  expanded  by  four  times  of  its  original   size!</p>
<p>White  crane  sea  area  was  about  to  be  engulfed  by  icy  sea  area.</p>
<p>“The  changes  in  the  world  have  created  an  unprecedented  chaotic  era.”  Nan   Gong  Yuan  sighed  deeply.</p>
<p>Nan  Gong  clan  was  doing  relatively  fine.</p>
<p>Su  clan’s  light  ripple  sea  fell  greatly  in  value  after  the  destruction  of  the   sun,  the  entirety  of  Su  clan  was  busy  trying  to  salvage  it  now.</p>
<p>Of  course,  there  were  super  forces  who  took  the  chance  to  gain  a  huge   profit.</p>
<p>For  example,  Eastern  Sea’s  Hua  clan.</p>
<p>Hua  clan’s  rank  eight  Immortal  Gu  House  Green  Cloud  Spark  Warship   entered  the  two  heavens  to  collect  a  vast  amount  of  cloud  path  resources,   the  other  Eastern  Sea  righteous  path  forces  were  feeling  deep  envy.</p>
<p>With  the  changes  going  on,  not  just  mortals  and  Gu  Masters  were  affected,   even  super  forces  and  Gu  Immortal  experts  were  implicated  in  this   commotion.</p>
<p>Some  were  overjoyed,  some  were  worried,  some  decided  to  leave  their   homelands  and  start  all  over  again.</p>
<p>In  the  pitch  black  night,  Lu  Qing  Ming  and  Su  Guang  were  flying  over  the   border  of  Northern  Plains  and  Western  Desert.</p>
<p>They  were  originally  the  Traveling  Three  Elites  but  after  Han  Dong’s  death,   only  two  were  left.</p>
<p>The  two  of  them  were  Northern  Plains  lone  immortals,  they  did  not  want  to   submit  to  the  Huang  Jin  tribes,  they  also  refused  to  join  Chu  Du,  Heavenly   Lord  Bai  Zu,  or  Fairy  Black  Moon.</p>
<p>In  the  huge  Gu  cultivation  world,  everyone  had  their  own  intentions.</p>
<p>Some  preferred  freedom  more  than  others.</p>
<p>As  Longevity  Heaven  exerted  more  influence,  there  was  less  and  less   survival  space  for  lone  cultivators  in  Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>The  situation  forced  Lu  Qing  Ming  and  Su  Guang  to  leave  Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>They  were  unwilling  to  go  to  Central  Continent  or  Eastern  Sea,  thus,  they   could  only  head  to  Western  Desert  or  Southern  Border.</p>
<p>Because  Lu  Qing  Ming  cultivated  wind  path  and  Su  Guang  cultivated  light   path,  they  were  more  suited  for  Western  Desert.</p>
<p>“Sigh,  we  had  to  leave  Northern  Plains  after  all.  At  this  moment,  I  finally   understand  the  meaning  of  why  it  is  hard  to  leave  your  homeland.”  Lu  Qing   Ming  sighed  gloomily.</p>
<p>Su  Guang  had  a  different  opinion:  ”Western  Desert  is  chaotic  now,  with   Fang  clan  drawing  everyone’s  attention,  it  is  more  suitable  for  us.  Let’s  go,   the  five  regional  walls  are  gone,  the  two  heavens  have  fused,  the  world  is   our  home.”</p>
<p>“Hehe.”  Lu  Qing  Ming  laughed:  ”You  are  more  carefree  than  me.”</p>
<p>But  at  the  next  moment,  their  expressions  changed.</p>
<p>The  terrifying  darkness  descended!</p>
<p>The  two  immortals  could  not  put  up  any  resistance,  the  mysterious  expert   grabbed  and  prevented  them  from  moving  at  all.</p>
<p>Lu  Qing  Ming  and  Su  Guang  were  filled  with  fear.</p>
<p>It  was  not  a  Gu  Immortal  who  captured  them  but  a  legendary  immemorial   desolate  beast.</p>
<p>This  legendary  immemorial  beast  was  like  a  giant,  it  was  blacker  than  ink.   Its  black  hair  flowed  like  a  cape,  extending  to  its  waist,  its  eyes  were  huge   and  emitting  a  fierce  red  light.</p>
<p>Right  now,  two  of  its  monstrous  claws  grabbed  onto  Lu  Qing  Ming  and  Su   Guang.</p>
<p>It  was  Zuo  Ye  Hui!</p>
<p>Zuo  Ye  Hui  said  in  a  hoarse  tone:  ”Gu  Immortals  from  Northern  Plains,   lead  the  way  for  me.  Tell  me,  how  do  I…  get  inside  Longevity  Heaven?”</p>
<p>Lu  Qing  Ming  and  Su  Guang  heard  this  and  their  faces  turned  pale  white.</p>
<p>Back  in  Western  Desert.</p>
<p>A  short  battle  had  already  concluded.</p>
<p>Flower  petals  descended  but  quickly  gathered  to  form  Wan  Zi  Hong’s  body.</p>
<p>She  looked  at  Ling  Hu  Xu’s  vanishing  figure  as  she  muttered:  ”Ling  Hu   Xu…  very  interesting.”</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin  had  an  unsightly  expression:  ”This  Ling  Hu  Xu  deserves   death!  If  he  had  not  used  Fang  clan’s  name  to  rob  various  places,  why   would  we  have  been  misled?”</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin  wanted  to  find  out  where  Fang  clan  was  hiding,  but  to   think  that  he  followed  the  wrong  traces.</p>
<p>Ling  Hu  Xu  was  a  rarely  seen  theft  path  Gu  Immortal,  he  had  once  stole   Fang  Dong  Xi’s  soul  cores  in  Sand  Heap  blessed  land.</p>
<p>Evidently,  he  did  not  just  steal  soul  cores  then,  he  even  had  a  method  to   disguise  himself  as  Fang  Dong  Xi.</p>
<p>While  everyone  was  flustered  after  Spectral  Soul  destroyed  the  sun,  he   committed  crimes  everywhere  and  purposely  left  clues  to  frame  them  on   Fang  clan.</p>
<p>In  the  end,  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  exposed  him.</p>
<p>The  pursuit  was  very  short,  Ling  Hu  Xu  only  had  rank  seven  cultivation   level  but  he  used  peculiar  theft  path  methods  to  defy  the  odds,  escaping   from  the  two  Heavenly  Court  rank  eight  experts!</p>
<p>Above  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Many  Gu  Immortals  were  focusing  their  gazes  on  Gu  Immortal  Zhang  Ji.</p>
<p>Zhang  Ji  successfully  arranged  the  final  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>“Alright,  prepare  to  activate  the  formation.”</p>
<p>“Tell  the  two  heavens’  grotto-heavens’  Gu  Immortals  to  be  mindful  of  the   formation  in  their  grotto-heavens!”</p>
<p>“Ask  the  immortals  in  the  formation  cores  to  inspect  it  again.”</p>
<p>The  star  array  calculation  formation  was  finally  activated  slowly  under  the   massive  arrangement.</p>
<p>One  star  shone  brightly  first,  followed  by  the  second  and  third  star…</p>
<p>After  more  than  ten  breaths  of  time,  countless  stars  illuminated  the  sky  of   Central  Continent,  a  beautiful  star  map  was  drawn  above  the  sky.</p>
<p>“The  star  array  calculation  formation  has  finally  been  completed.”</p>
<p>Li  Xiao  Bai  looked  at  this  as  he  sighed  internally.</p>
<p>Not  long  ago,  Fang  Yuan  had  secretly  contacted  him.</p>
<p>After  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  joined  Heavenly  Court,  Li  Xiao   Bai  started  to  show  immense  value.</p>
<p>But  at  the  same  time,  Fang  Yuan  needed  to  be  very  careful.</p>
<p>Li  Xiao  Bai  was  his  clone,  if  he  was  exposed  and  captured,  he  would   become  a  huge  weakness  of  Fang  Yuan’s!</p>
