    <p>:  Spectral  Soul  Destroys  The  Sun</p>
<p>Regarding  Fang  Yuan’s  shamelessness,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  could  not  do  anything  but  amazement.</p>
<p>She  had  no  choice  but  to  admit  that  Fang  Yuan’s  second  declaration  was  a   brilliant  move  that  dealt  with  the  situation  effectively.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  lowered  the  entry  and  exit  criteria  for  the  Heaven  and  Earth   Great  Love  Alliance,  he  did  not  consider  the  loyalty  of  these  members,   creating  a  whole  new  commotion!</p>
<p>Using  benefits  to  lure  them,  he  displayed  the  advantage  of  refinement  path,   this  was  something  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable  could  not  match,  they  had  no  way  of  stopping  him.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  certain:  Right  now,  all  the  Gu   Immortals  in  the  world  were  greatly  moved,  even  the  Gu  Immortals  of  the   Central  Continent’s  ten  great  ancient  sects  were  thinking  of  whether  they   could  join  the  Heaven  and  Earth  Great  Love  Alliance  now!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  could  restrain  them  and  not  let  them   join  the  alliance,  but  she  could  not  stop  them  from  thinking!</p>
<p>Human  minds  were  fickle!</p>
<p>And  in  this  entire  fiasco,  what  did  Fang  Yuan  lose?</p>
<p>Basically  nothing.</p>
<p>Originally,  he  had  taken  in  subordinates  from  Eastern  Sea  and  the  two   heavens,  they  had  no  loyalty  towards  him.</p>
<p>They  had  to  join  him  because  of  the  situation,  it  was  not  of  their  own  will.</p>
<p>It  was  unrealistic  for  Fang  Yuan  to  depend  on  them  if  he  wanted  to  attack   Central  Continent  or  the  other  regions.  From  Qin  Ding  Ling’s  success  in   making  these  people  betray  him,  it  showed  that  none  of  them  had  any   loyalty  to  him.</p>
<p>If  there  was  only  one  venerable  in  the  current  world,  everyone  would  be   completely  at  his  beck  and  call.  But  with  the  era  of  four  concurrent   venerables,  as  well  as  the  contest  of  three  venerables,  these  Gu  Immortals   were  able  to  make  a  choice.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly.</p>
<p>She  knew  that  Fang  Yuan  contacted  her  not  to  show  off  or  brag  about  his   move.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  suggestion  for  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  join   the  Heaven  and  Earth  Great  Love  Alliance  was  a  joke.  He  knew  that  Star</p>
<p>Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  would  not  join  the  alliance  and  raise  his   prestige.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  true  goal  was  to  threaten  her.</p>
<p>Currently,  Central  Continent  was  assembling  a  formation  of  an   unprecedented  scale.</p>
<p>At  this  crucial  moment,  if  Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable  or  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  made  their  move,  it  could  easily  cause  the  formation  to   crumble  and  fail.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan  has  little  immortal  essence,  he  does  not  want  to  come  and   destroy  my  star  array  calculation  formation,  but  he  does  not  want  me  to   succeed  either,  thus,  he  contacted  me.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  always  been  showing  an  anxious  attitude  as  he  used  various   Immortal  Gu  to  exchange  for  resource  points,  it  seemed  like  he  was  trying   to  raise  the  foundation  of  his  immortal  aperture  to  increase  his  immortal   essence  production.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  made  many  investigation  attempts   but  similar  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  they  could  not  see  the  truth   that  Fang  Yuan  was  concealing.</p>
<p>Thus,  all  along,  she  felt  that  Fang  Yuan  lacked  immortal  essence.</p>
<p>This  was  a  deep  impression  that  he  imprinted  in  her.</p>
<p>She  was  not  surprised  that  Fang  Yuan  contacted  her.</p>
<p>Immediately,  she  agreed  to  have  a  transaction  with  Fang  Yuan,  Heavenly   Court  would  pay  resource  points,  Primordial  Domain,  and  immortal</p>
<p>materials  in  exchange  for  Fang  Yuan’s  refinement  of  Immortal  Gu  for  them.</p>
<p>The  transaction  was  of  a  huge  scale,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   even  emphasized  that  the  transactions  would  be  done  in  batches,  this  entire   duration  would  be  quite  lengthy.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  doing  this   to  ensure  her  formation’s  safety.</p>
<p>This  was  something  Fang  Yuan  had  expected.</p>
<p>According  to  the  arrangement  of  this  incomplete  formation,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  not  making  an  exceptional   formation,  it  was  within  Fang  Yuan’s  tolerance  level.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  gave  up  on  destroying  it  to  obtain  a  beneficial  transaction,  this   was  an  assured  gain  for  him.</p>
<p>Especially  when  he  was  refining  heavenly  secret  Gu  now!</p>
<p>At  this  juncture,  Fang  Yuan  could  not  attack  abruptly.</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  know  this.</p>
<p>It  was  even  quite  a  surprise  that  she  was  willing  to  use  Primordial  Domain   as  one  of  the  transaction  goods.</p>
<p>Before  this,  Fang  Yuan  had  always  been  negotiating  with  Heavenly  Court  to   buy  their  Primordial  Domain.</p>
<p>The  Primordial  Domain  had  much  greater  value  to  him  than  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  or  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  never  agreed  to  it,  but  now,  she   was  willing  to  give  up  some  of  the  Primordial  Domain  to  lure  Fang  Yuan   into  accepting  the  transaction.</p>
<p>“It  is  likely  that  in  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  perspective,  I   have  not  taken  the  Primordial  Domain  in  treasure  yellow  heaven  because  I   lack  methods  to  retrieve  it.  Thus,  giving  me  a  portion  of  the  Primordial   Domain  now  will  not  allow  me  to  gain  any  advantage  in  a  short  period  of   time.”</p>
<p>“To  think  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  will  be  the  first  person   to  sell  me  Primordial  Domain,  I  thought  that  I  would  have  gotten  it  first   through  a  blood  path  transaction  with  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable!”</p>
<p>While  thinking  of  this,  Fang  Yuan  multi-tasked  and  contacted  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable:  ”Friend  Giant  Sun,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  has  made  such  a  huge  move,  the  formation  she  is  setting  up  must   be  quite  important.  She  is  the  number  one  wisdom  path  cultivator   throughout  history,  with  this  formation’s  help,  she  will  be  able  to  scheme  in   the  future  without  us  even  knowing  it.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  laughed  and  quickly  replied:  ”So  what  do   you  want  to  do?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  said  directly:  ”I  am  willing  to  join  hands  with  you  to  deal  with   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  destroy  her  formation!  Wisdom   path  is  not  simple,  we  saw  its  power  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave.  We  really   should  not  let  her  create  this  immortal  formation.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  gave  an  ambiguous  answer:  ”That  is  a  good   suggestion,  so,  Great  Love,  have  you  considered  Heavenly  Lord  Bai  Zu’s   suggestion  already?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  chuckled:  ”We  can  always  talk  about  it.  I  have  a  lot  of  blood   path  research  results  and  also  blood  path  Immortal  Gu.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  always  wanted  to  buy  Fang  Yuan’s   blood  path  resources,  now  that  Fang  Yuan  gave  in,  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  smiled  and  immediately  contacted  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable.</p>
<p>“Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  just  contacted  me,  he  wants  us  to   attack  your  formation  together.  What  do  you  think  about  that?”  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  immediately  exposed  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly  to  herself,  she  used  a   similar  method  to  make  a  transaction  with  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>The  three  venerables  continued  to  negotiate  and  plot  against  each  other.</p>
<p>As  a  wisdom  path  Gu  cultivator,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was   superior  than  the  others,  she  vaguely  held  the  upper  hand.</p>
<p>Eventually,  she  gave  up  some  benefits  to  temporarily  appease  Fang  Yuan   and  Giant  Sun.</p>
<p>“I  finally  stabilized  these  two,  but  if  the  formation  I  am  making  is  any   stronger,  this  situation  will  be  harder  to  deal  with.”</p>
<p>It  was  not  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  lacked  a  better   formation,  but  she  could  not  create  it  now.</p>
<p>If  she  tried  to,  the  two  venerables  would  try  to  destroy  it.</p>
<p>There  would  be  no  way  of  talking  them  out  of  it.</p>
<p>Star  array  calculation  formation  was  specially  chosen  by  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  as  it  did  not  cross  their  bottom-line.  The  two   venerables  were  willing  to  let  her  create  it  in  exchange  for  some  personal   benefits.</p>
<p>This  was  the  precise  control  of  the  situation  that  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  had  in  this  contest  of  three  venerables.</p>
<p>‘Of  course,  the  most  important  thing  is  still  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.’  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  thought  to  herself:  ’The   reason  why  both  venerables  are  willing  to  watch  on  the  fence  is  because  of   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  primarily.”</p>
<p>Compared  to  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  formation  was  nothing  outstanding!</p>
<p>The  three  venerables  were  paying  close  attention  to  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable’s  actions.</p>
<p>As  what  they  expected,  after  getting  rid  of  the  white  heaven  grotto-heavens   that  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  could  sense,  he  went  after  the  sun!</p>
<p>Within  the  fused  two  heavens,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  charged   towards  the  sun  like  a  mountain-like  shadowy  figure.</p>
<p>This  scene  was  seen  through  Fang  Yuan’s  investigative  method,  he   pondered:  ”Back  then,  I  used  up  white  heaven’s  heavenly  spirit,  causing   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  to  be  unable  to  control  immemorial  white   heaven  directly.  He  has  only  devoured  black  heaven’s  heavenly  spirit,  so  he   can  only  devour  immemorial  white  heaven  through  the  entire  immemorial   black  heaven!”</p>
<p>“Right  now,  among  the  two  heavens’  grotto-heavens,  those  from  white   heaven  are  basically  all  destroyed.  The  heaven  vein  nodes  that  are   contained  within  these  grotto-heavens  have  all  been  destroyed  by  Spectral   Soul  Demon  Venerable.”</p>
<p>“As  for  Longevity  Heaven  and  Heavenly  Court,  they  have  tight  defenses   that  prevents  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  from  detecting  them  in  his   current  state.”</p>
<p>“Thus,  his  only  target  now  is  the  sun!”</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  charged  towards  the  sun,  but  this  attempt   was  different  from  before,  he  shouted  and  roared  with  unprecedented   determination  and  killing  intent.</p>
<p>However,  the  closer  he  got  to  the  sun,  the  more  obstruction  he  felt  from  the   massive  number  of  fire  path  and  light  path  dao  marks.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  body  started  to  melt  like  a  candle,  tiny   flames  could  be  seen  appearing  on  his  entire  body.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  looked  at  the  immemorial  two  heavens  while   paying  close  attention  to  this  situation,  he  evaluated  internally:  ”  The  sun   has  existed  since  immemorial  times,  it  has  vast  and  boundless  power.  It  is   the  largest  heaven  vein  node  in  the  entire  world,  it  is  also  the  greatest  light   vein  and  fire  vein  node  in  the  two  heavens.”</p>
<p>“Even  in  my  previous  life,  when  I  was  at  my  strongest,  I  could  not  deal  with   the  sun  easily.  Now  that  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  has  lost  his  mind,   it  will  be  even  harder  for  him  to  deal  with  it.”</p>
<p>When  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  alive  back  then,  he  was  invincible   in  the  world,  he  could  naturally  destroy  the  sun.</p>
<p>But  doing  that  had  no  advantage  to  him,  it  was  even  very  harmful  to  the   myriad  lifeforms.</p>
<p>Thus,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  do  that.</p>
<p>Eventually,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  charged  into  the  sun  as   countless  black  pillar-like  arms  stretched  out  and  grabbed  at  it,  his  colossal   body  slammed  into  the  sun  and  caused  flames  to  flicker.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  he  suffered  severe  injuries.</p>
<p>His  body  melted  rapidly  as  a  vast  number  of  light  path  and  fire  path  dao   marks  were  carved  on  him.</p>
<p>All  of  his  accumulated  soul  path  dao  marks  were  rapidly  breaking  apart!</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  three  heads  were  screaming  out  in  pain,   his  eyes  became  filled  with  anger  and  hatred.</p>
<p>Following  his  instincts,  he  activated  a  defensive  killer  move  as  a  layer  of   eerie  light  covered  his  whole  body,  black  smoke  gushed  out  fiercely  and   resisted  the  immense  power  of  the  sun.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  managed  to  control  the  situation  for  now.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  stayed  in  Embroidered  Tower  as  she   looked  out  of  the  window.</p>
<p>“The  sun  is  a  congregation  of  heaven  path,  light  path,  and  fire  path  dao   marks,  it  is  tangible  but  not  solid.  It  can  be  seen  as  a  tribulation  that  has   been  ongoing  for  countless  years,  it  had  started  accumulating  since  the  start   of  the  world.  Thus,  even  though  it  is  not  a  chaotic  disaster,  it  is  hard  to  deal   with  even  for  a  venerable.”</p>
<p>“By  attacking  the  sun,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  will  likely  end  up   badly  alongside  it.  By  then,  it  will  be  time  to  make  my  move.”</p>
<p>“If  I  can  eliminate  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  it  will  benefit  Heavenly   Court  greatly.  By  then,  I  can  even  give  in  to  the  other  two  venerables  to  a   greater  extent.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  understood  when  to  yield  and  when   not  to.</p>
<p>For  Heavenly  Court,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  a  huge  threat.</p>
<p>Because  Heavenly  Court  was  situated  in  immemorial  white  heaven,  it  was   the  largest  heaven  vein  node  in  the  world.</p>
<p>It  was  just  that  Heavenly  Court  was  concealed  by  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  wisdom  path  method,  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  could  not  detect  it.</p>
<p>But  right  at  this  moment,  there  was  an  abrupt  change!</p>
<p>A  mountain-like  beast  escaped  in  fear  while  carrying  a  trace  of  the  aura  of  a   rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>“There  is  actually  a  legendary  immemorial  desolate  beast  hiding  inside  the   sun?  It  has  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu?”  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  was  shook.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  eyes  widened:  ”No,  not  just  one  rank  nine   Immortal  Gu,  it  has  another  one!”</p>
<p>The  three  venerables  observed  closely  as  the  wild  rank  nine  fire  Gu  within   the  sun  was  no  longer  concealed.</p>
<p>After  a  few  breaths  of  time,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  arrived  at  the   center  of  the  sun,  the  remaining  tens  of  arms  stretched  out  and  grabbed  fire   Gu  despite  the  intense  flames.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  left  head  opened  its  mouth  and  instantly   devoured  fire  Gu.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  cried  out  in  agony.</p>
<p>His  left  head  was  burning  like  a  flame  pillar.</p>
<p>Without  the  support  of  the  two  Gu,  the  sun  exploded  with  a  loud  sound  that   spread  throughout  the  entire  world.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  all  lifeforms  in  the  world  looked  up,  they  had  fearful   expressions  as  they  witnessed  the  sun  turning  into  countless  lumps  of  light   and  fire,  breaking  up  and  spreading  throughout  heaven  and  earth.</p>
<p>The  sun  —  was  destroyed!</p>
