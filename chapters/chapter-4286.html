        <p>: Giving Heavenly Court Two Slaps</p>
<p>Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu was convinced, he gritted his teeth and said: "Does Heavenly Court have a way to relocate my grotto-heaven?"</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling smiled lightly; "Of course we do. The foundation of Heavenly Court cannot be matched by Longevity Heaven or Fang Yuan. Believe me, joining Heavenly Court is the wisest decision!"</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu sighed deeply and replied: "This is a huge matter, do allow me to return to the grotto-heaven and hold a meeting with the other Gu Immortals."</p>
<p>"We will wait here for the good news." Qin Ding Ling showed a very understanding demeanor.</p>
<p>After Old Immortal Hua Yu returned to the grotto-heaven, he assembled the immortals and explained the situation to them.</p>
<p>Although they were shocked, after three days and nights, they all agreed with Old Immortal Hua Yu's decision to switch sides to Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>Li Xiao Bai was among them, he also agreed to join Heavenly Court but he was feeling nervous internally.</p>
<p>If Star Constellation Immortal Venerable used an investigative method on him, she might find out his relationship with Fang Yuan. But he was just one person, while the intention to join Heavenly Court had already been acknowledged among everyone.</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu led the immortals out of the grotto-heaven, they met with Qin Ding Ling and Jun Shen Guang.</p>
<p>"Good, good, good." Qin Ding Ling welcomed them as she said: "Everyone, by joining the right side, not only will you gain immense benefits, you will also create a brighter future for your descendants."</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu followed: "Indeed, we should share such joyful news with others. I hope Lady Qin Ding Ling and Lord Jun Shen Guang can help, I am willing to take a risk and rescue more friends from this demonic Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance."</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling and Jun Shen Guang heard his words and laughed joyfully.</p>
<p>With Old Immortal Hua Yu taking the lead, and an example like Liang Jing Jing, because Qin Ding Ling also used a luck path killer move earlier, their journey in convincing the rest to join them went smoothly.</p>
<p>Several days later.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the human forces of the two heavens' grotto-heavens had betrayed Fang Yuan, they went to join Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>To speak the truth, Qin Ding Ling had only planned to recruit Old Immortal Hua Yu, but after they took action, the results were actually much better than expected.</p>
<p>Such news could not be hidden, soon, the entire five regions' Gu Immortals went into an uproar.</p>
<p>"Heavenly Court is still Heavenly Court after all!"</p>
<p>"Fang Yuan suffered a loss again."</p>
<p>"Earlier in Western Desert, Heavenly Court won and forced Fang clan to sell all their resource points as they fled from their territory."</p>
<p>"Now, Fang Yuan's influence in the two heavens has mostly been uprooted by Heavenly Court."</p>
<p>"Even though Fang Yuan is a venerable, he cultivates refinement path. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable is a wisdom path venerable, she is most skilled at plotting and making use of people's feelings."</p>
<p>"To speak the truth, I can understand why they chose to join Heavenly Court. After all, Fang Yuan did nothing and allowed Spectral Soul Demon Venerable to slaughter and cause destruction in the two heavens, this is not what a leader should do. There are even rumors that Fang Yuan took Liang Jing Jing's light heaven without helping out!"</p>
<p>The Gu Immortals discussed among themselves.</p>
<p>Every action of a venerable, no matter how small, was a huge matter in the Gu Immortal world, it would draw the attention of everyone.</p>
<p>Many people started to guess what Fang Yuan would do now.</p>
<p>Would he take revenge? Would he take action to pursue those grotto-heaven forces that betrayed him?</p>
<p>Or would he just take this loss silently?</p>
<p>"If I were him, I would definitely take action! Traitors need to be punished, if they have an easier life after this, what will the other members of the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance think?"</p>
<p>"If they can betray him so easily, aren't they simply disregarding the status of Great Love Immortal Venerable?"</p>
<p>"Maybe they are just bullying Lord Fang Yuan for being a newly advanced venerable."</p>
<p>"How can the pride of a venerable be provoked so easily?"</p>
<p>Soon, waves of discussion erupted, becoming the main topic of treasure yellow heaven.</p>
<p>"Hehe." Wu Yong smiled coldly, he did not need to guess to know that this discussion was driven by Longevity Heaven.</p>
<p>If he could force Heaven Refining Demon Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable to enter battle from this, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable would benefit immensely.</p>
<p>"Fang Yuan will not make a move, I know him too well." Wu Yong looked in the direction of Eastern Sea as he sighed deeply.</p>
<p>If it were him, he would not do anything either.</p>
<p>If a move was made, Fang Yuan would need to fight against Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, this was extremely disadvantageous.</p>
<p>"With the contest of three venerables, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable clearly has the upper hand. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable have their stronghold respectively, while Fang Yuan lacks in this aspect while also having the least immortal essence."</p>
<p>"In this situation, he needs to be even more vigilant. If he takes action abruptly, he will likely be disadvantaged even further."</p>
<p>"The rumors should be true, Fang Yuan took the light heaven but did not help her. In this aspect, I cannot compare to him."</p>
<p>Comparing himself to Fang Yuan, Wu Yong reflected upon himself and felt that his shamelessness was still not enough, he had much to learn.</p>
<p>What were reputation and prestige?</p>
<p>They were just elements that were necessary to survive or gain victory.</p>
<p>If reputation or prestige were not useful for survival or claiming victory, then they should be discarded immediately.</p>
<p>When it was time to be shameless, one needed to be resolutely shameless!</p>
<p>"It is time."</p>
<p>"It is time to join the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance."</p>
<p>Bright light flickered in Wu Yong's eyes continuously.</p>
<p>Right when everyone thought poorly of Fang Yuan and felt that he was the weakest among the three venerables, Wu Yong made a decision that was the opposite of everyone else!</p>
<p>Fang Yuan accepted it without hesitation.</p>
<p>Once news spread, Southern Border's Gu Immortal world became shocked, the entire five regions' Gu Immortal world was shaken.</p>
<p>Fang clan who joined the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance lost their territory and had to flee. A large number of super forces in the two heavens also left the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance.</p>
<p>In this situation, Wu clan went against the trend and publicly joined the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance, this was a questionable action that drew disdain from others.</p>
<p>Southern Border's Gu Immortal world was shaken, doubts towards Wu Yong soon rose and erupted into a storm.</p>
<p>But Wu clan, who was at the center of the storm, stayed united against all resistance, no matter how they were targeted, they remained unmoving like a monolith, showing no weaknesses at all.</p>
<p>Back in Western Desert.</p>
<p>"Southern Border's Wu Yong… I've heard of his name long ago, but his courage and foresight are truly admirable." Fang Gong said in amazement.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang nodded: "I wonder how much benefit he obtained from Fang Yuan by using the entire Wu clan as the stake to publicly join the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance."</p>
<p>"Regardless of the results, this is a grand leader with huge ambitions! Wu clan has been Southern Border's number one super force for a long time, but they still made such a risky move. My Fang clan is far inferior to Wu clan</p>
<p>to begin with, so how can we not have the same resolve as them?" Fang Hua Sheng smiled.</p>
<p>"Third supreme elder is right! Our Fang clan has already rested sufficiently, all sorts of resource points have been transacted for Immortal Gu, Fang An Lei and Fang Chen have also returned already, and our Immortal Gu Houses have been improved further. It is time to take action!" Fang Leng shouted with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Fang clan lost all their territory, they became a roaming force without a base.</p>
<p>But in this situation, youngsters like Fang Leng grew up and matured rapidly, they became more proactive and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang looked towards the other Gu Immortals as he said: "What do you think?"</p>
<p>"I think we can make a move now!"</p>
<p>"If we stay cooped up in here, I feel like I will turn rusty soon."</p>
<p>"We need to show those super forces that bullied our Fang clan that there is a huge price to pay for provoking us!"</p>
<p>After seeing that their Gu Immortals had high morale, Fang Gong became very happy: "Good, we will teach them a lesson that they will never forget!"</p>
<p>The first supreme elder showed a clear attitude, Fang clan's immortals had shining eyes as their expressions became even more heated.</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang nodded lightly and tossed out an information path Gu worm which turned into a map in the air: "We will target this place."</p>
<p>The immortals looked and had a change of expressions, they did not think that Fang Di Chang would make such a decision.</p>
<p>"This is… earthly flame forest?"</p>
<p>"This is Dong clan's number one resource point! It is tightly defended."</p>
<p>"Is this too aggressive?"</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang smiled: "Everyone, listen to me. The earthly flame forest is not made of trees but flame pillars from underground instead. After reaching a breaking point, they will spew out of the surface and form into flames that resemble trees. The cause is the fire path dao vein underground."</p>
<p>"However, with the unification of five regions, the regional walls vanished and the earth veins relocated drastically. Thus, that fire path dao vein is also shifting."</p>
<p>"Earlier, Dong clan set up an immortal formation there using the original location without any Immortal Gu. Currently, it is at the breaking point, it is like a paper window that can be pierced with just one strike!"</p>
<p>"And most crucially, the mission board of our alliance has changed. Earth path resource points are now exchanging for less contribution points while wind path and fire path resource points have grown in value. Thus, by attacking this spot, we can gain even more contribution points!"</p>
<p>After the Fang clan immortals heard this, they understood that Fang Di Chang had planned this after much preparation and consideration.</p>
<p>"As expected of Lord Fang Di Chang." Fang Chen sighed.</p>
<p>"Since second supreme elder has decided upon this, we will trust you!" Fang An Lei expressed her view.</p>
<p>"Then let us take down this earthly flame forest, hahaha." Old Ghost Bai Jun was Fang clan's slave Gu Immortal, he also showed his stance.</p>
<p>"I can't wait anymore." Fang Dong Xi rubbed his palms together.</p>
<p>Although he had revived and retained his rank seven cultivation, his immortal aperture was empty and needed development.</p>
<p>Earlier, when the Fang clansmen were sold, he had gone to Xiao Ye Hu for a transaction but found that Wang Xiao Er had been bought already.</p>
<p>As for the other Fang clan members, because of Fang Di Chang's words, to play it safe for now, they did not buy them.</p>
<p>Several days later.</p>
<p>Fang clan moved out all at once, successfully assaulting earthly flame forest.</p>
<p>Fang clan had a huge force now while Dong clan had just lost their Red River Wheel.</p>
<p>Dong clan's first supreme elder did not hesitate, he immediately requested for help from the other super forces.</p>
<p>After Dong clan gathered many Gu Immortals and several Immortal Gu Houses, they went to reinforce the resource point but found that it was in a state of ruin and destruction.</p>
<p>Fang clan had not just retreated and vanished into thin air, they even moved the entire mountain-like area of the earthly flame forest, including the ground itself, into treasure yellow heaven.</p>
<p>Western Desert's Gu Immortals were shaken!</p>
<p>The five regions' Gu Immortals were stunned.</p>
<p>Right when Dong clan's first supreme elder hesitated on whether to organize a second anti-Fang alliance, Fang clan struck again and targeted the other super forces' resource points, after succeeding, they easily retreated.</p>
<p>The five regions went into an uproar!</p>
<p>Western Desert's super forces started to become fearful, everyone started to focus on defending themselves.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan did not make a move on the two heavens' grotto-heavens from start to finish. But Southern Border's Wu clan and Western Desert's Fang clan had taken action instead, this was like giving Heavenly Court two slaps across the face, creating two loud sounds that resounded in the entire world.</p>
