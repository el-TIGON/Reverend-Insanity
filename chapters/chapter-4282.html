        <p>: Left To Their Own Devices</p>
<p>Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p>
<p>At once, the situation became very complex.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable broke through the heavenly chasm and chased after them.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie were trapped in the middle.</p>
<p>Heavenly Court's three immortals, Golden Hooped Great Immortal, Seven Fiendish Primeval Monarch, and Duke Mei stood in front of the Shadow Sect members, while Feng Jiu Ge was indeed hiding nearby like what Fairy Zi Wei predicted.</p>
<p>If Spectral Soul Demon Venerable had his sanity, Feng Jiu Ge would not do this, that was too risky.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei was really only trying her luck earlier.</p>
<p>She could not be certain of Feng Jiu Ge's location, this was only a possibility she deduced.</p>
<p>After all, Feng Jiu Ge did not kill them but used a method on them. This meant that Feng Jiu Ge wanted to make use of the two.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei was in a desperate situation, she had to use all the methods she could think of, in that situation, Feng Jiu Ge became her hope.</p>
<p>But Feng Jiu Ge showed no signs of helping.</p>
<p>He squinted as he looked at the two Shadow Sect immortals from afar, he sighed internally: "It is useless, I can already hear the cries of your destiny,</p>
<p>even though it has some turbulence, it is en-route to the abyss, the outcome has been decided."</p>
<p>During this period when he went missing, he had been cultivating the killer move destiny song, he made a lot of progress.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's left head growled as soul balls appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>The soul balls had tiny tadpole-like tails behind them as they quickly got close to Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie, before exploding intensely.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie could not resist them, their souls shook and almost shattered on the spot.</p>
<p>"Attack!" At the other end, Duke Mei was the first to use his killer move.</p>
<p>Golden Hooped Great Immortal and Seven Fiendish Primeval Monarch followed closely after.</p>
<p>"I am going to die!" Ying Wu Xie's expression was ashen.</p>
<p>"How can this be?" At the next moment, Fairy Zi Wei's expression turned to shock.</p>
<p>Because the Heavenly Court immortals' attacks were not aimed at them but Spectral Soul Demon Venerable instead, they resisted the soul ball method while helping to defend the Shadow Sect immortals.</p>
<p>Heavenly Court was saving the Shadow Sect immortals?</p>
<p>Even a wisdom path great expert like Fairy Zi Wei was stunned.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me, because Star Constellation Immortal Venerable revived, she is allowing me to return to Heavenly Court in exchange for betraying master?"</p>
<p>"Or maybe, they want to capture the crucial split soul, Ying Wu Xie, to use a method against master?"</p>
<p>Methods to create clones were convenient but they also exposed a weakness.</p>
<p>In this world, nothing was perfect.</p>
<p>With benefit came cost.</p>
<p>Clone methods had many demerits, the main thing was that their connection to the main body could be exploited.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's split soul had a weakness that was exposed long ago.</p>
<p>It was the sharing of attainment level.</p>
<p>It was an advantage and also a disadvantage.</p>
<p>When Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's clone created sovereign immortal fetus Gu, a vast amount of attainment levels were expended, forming dream realms.</p>
<p>This caused Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's own attainment level to fall as well.</p>
<p>Regardless of the intention of the three Heavenly Court immortals, the Shadow Sect immortals had survived because of them.</p>
<p>Far away, Feng Jiu Ge shook his head.</p>
<p>Be it the Shadow Sect immortals or Heavenly Court's three immortals, their efforts were all in vain.</p>
<p>As expected, the number of soul balls continued to increase, they grew to a scale that the five immortals had trouble defending against.</p>
<p>Be it Fairy Zi Wei or Duke Mei, they were all in desperation.</p>
<p>"Is this the might of a venerable?!"</p>
<p>"Spectral Soul Demon Venerable has lost his senses and even has such heavy injuries…"</p>
<p>"Damn it!"</p>
<p>The Heavenly Court immortals could not save the Shadow Sect immortals, they were implicated instead and became Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's next targets.</p>
<p>At the next moment, a huge number of soul balls would explode intensely and take the lives of these five immortals…</p>
<p>At this moment.</p>
<p>Feng Jiu Ge's expression changed.</p>
<p>"Oh?" At this moment, he felt a vast power rampaging into the battlefield.</p>
<p>This was the power of luck path, it was grand and vast!</p>
<p>"Luck path… is the representation of uncertainty."</p>
<p>"This power was initially small, but as the luck path dao marks in the two heavens grew, a huge variable was created. Who is the source of this?"</p>
<p>Feng Jiu Ge pondered deeply.</p>
<p>The power of luck path was so grand it was on par with a rank nine killer move!</p>
<p>Crack crack.</p>
<p>The power of luck path changed the two heavens, it changed the entire battlefield.</p>
<p>Originally, the two heavens were fusing together, black heaven and white heaven were joining together piece and piece. The five immortals were in the area of white heaven.</p>
<p>But now, the immemorial black heaven fragment flew towards them from afar.</p>
<p>White heaven had abundant light path dao marks, while black heaven had more dark path dao marks, because of the conflict of dao marks, as the immemorial black heaven approached, white heaven's fragment shattered.</p>
<p>A large number of black and white heaven fragments created a huge current.</p>
<p>The current swept like a torrent, bringing Spectral Soul Demon Venerable along with it.</p>
<p>Without Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's control, the soul balls stayed at their spots without moving or exploding.</p>
<p>"We need to go!" Using this chance, Fairy Zi Wei brought Ying Wu Xie along as they flew into the immemorial black heaven that was right beside them.</p>
<p>"Wait." The three Heavenly Court immortals quickly chased them.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable was swept away by the two heavens' current, but after it weakened, he was freed again.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable was covered in injuries currently, heaven path dao marks were carved all over his injuries. There were even fragments of the two heavens stabbed into his body, it was as if he was stabbed by countless mirrors.</p>
<p>Because he was far away and due to the heaven path dao marks on his injuries, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable could no longer sense Ying Wu Xie.</p>
<p>He was senseless and could not use investigative or tracking methods.</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable roared in anger and vented for some time before he was lured towards a nearby grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>This was Flickering Light grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>Inside, the leader of Flickering Light grotto-heaven, Gu Immortal Liang Jing Jing, was already trembling in fear.</p>
<p>In the past, with Flickering Light grotto-heaven hidden and condensed into a tiny spot, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable would not be able to find it in his current state.</p>
<p>But now, the fusion of the two heavens had reached the most intense moment, as a heaven vein node, Flickering Light grotto-heaven was affected by it and got exposed to the outside world.</p>
<p>"Alliance Leader, save me!!" Liang Jing Jing did not hesitate, she quickly asked Fang Yuan for help.</p>
<p>"I am willing to contribute light heaven for a large amount of contribution points in exchange for Lord Alliance Leader's help to save my Flickering Light grotto-heaven!" Liang Jing Jing screamed out in terror.</p>
<p>"Light heaven?" Fang Yuan quickly received Liang Jing Jing's distress message while he was unsealing the truthful floating ice.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, he learned of light heaven.</p>
<p>Flickering Light grotto-heaven had devoured many fragments of the immemorial nine heavens, but its inner space was still too small.</p>
<p>A certain generation's Flickering Light Grotto Lord came up with a brilliant plan to develop the grotto-heaven, that was to create an artificial heaven.</p>
<p>That was the source of light heaven.</p>
<p>From then on, the generations of Gu Immortals of Flickering Light grotto- heaven spent their lives to work on this grand plan, contributing everything into this.</p>
<p>They collected heavenly light and refined them carefully, slowly expanding the light heaven of Flickering Light grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>Its current size had already surpassed the original space of Flickering Light grotto-heaven itself.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan quickly considered this.</p>
<p>His original plan was to let Zhan Bu Du stabilize the immortal aperture while he built more resource points and created more dao veins. After that, he would absorb the Primordial Domain and gain a huge boost of attainment levels.</p>
<p>With the attainment levels and stabilized the sovereign immortal aperture, he would be able to annex more grotto-heavens of the two heavens.</p>
<p>In the current situation, Flickering Light grotto-heaven was going to be destroyed, Fang Yuan's plans were unable to keep up with the development of events.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan was currently only a master in light path.</p>
<p>If he wanted to defend Flickering Light grotto-heaven, he would need to fight against Spectral Soul Demon Venerable. If the battle becomes too intense and obscured heavenly secret fails, he would be exposed, causing Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable to attack him at the same time.</p>
<p>And most crucially, against other venerables, Fang Yuan did not have much of an advantage.</p>
<p>Even though he had two rank nine Immortal Gu, he had not created complementary killer moves to use them with. He also had refinement path as his main path, it was not specialized in fighting.</p>
<p>"If the venerables end up fighting, I only have an advantage in immortal essence. However, if they join up to suppress me, my immortal essence will be countered by their sheer number."</p>
<p>"I cannot save Flickering Light grotto-heaven!"</p>
<p>Fang Yuan decided to abandon Flickering Light grotto-heaven resolutely.</p>
<p>"Lord Alliance Leader, this light heaven is incredibly valuable, if you place it in the sovereign immortal aperture, it will be a great addition." Liang Jing Jing urged, this was the only thing that she could offer to Fang Yuan now.</p>
<p>"Lord Alliance Leader, can you hear me? Please reply to me!!!" Liang Jing Jing stomped her feet in anxiety.</p>
<p>But now, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable had already arrived, with a loud sound, he destroyed the grotto-heaven's entrance.</p>
<p>Hundreds or thousands of arms entered the immortal aperture, wherever they went, lives were slaughtered, nobody could defend against the might of the venerable!</p>
<p>Liang Jing Jing had to hide in light heaven while she cried and sought help from Fang Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan had an indifferent expression, he knew that this decision would affect his prestige, but fighting against Spectral Soul Demon Venerable was even worse.</p>
<p>These subordinates were only tools in his contest against the venerables, he would not sacrifice his own benefits for just one of these tools.</p>
<p>Chess pieces were pieces because they were meant to be used, they were also meant to be discarded when necessary.</p>
<p>"Fang Yuan, I hate you, I hate you! How dare you call yourself Great Love Immortal Venerable? I was wrong about you, you are leaving us to die, you are not fit to be the alliance leader!!" Liang Jing Jing cursed in despair.</p>
<p>At this moment, Fang Yuan showed a joyful expression.</p>
<p>He had reached a qualitative development in unsealing the truthful floating ice.</p>
<p>His heaven path attainment level reached grandmaster!</p>
<p>The number of heaven path dao marks rose drastically, while other paths' attainment level also grew slightly.</p>
<p>And most importantly, he gained heavenly secret Gu's rank nine recipe!</p>
<p>"Rank nine heavenly secret Gu?"</p>
<p>This was an unexpected gain for Fang Yuan.</p>
<p>Even someone like him could not help but feel his eyes light up.</p>
<p>"It was really wise to not save Flickering Light grotto-heaven."</p>
<p>"That was close…"</p>
<p>"If I had interfered to save Flickering Light grotto-heaven, it would trigger a battle between venerables later. I would have been a step away from obtaining rank nine heavenly secret Immortal Gu's recipe!"</p>
<p>This Immortal Gu recipe came at the perfect timing, it was very useful to Fang Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan immediately decided that his third rank nine Immortal Gu would be — Heavenly Secret!</p>
