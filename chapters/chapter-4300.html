        <p>:  Fang  Yuan  Takes  A  Risk</p>
<p>The  appearance  of  Light  Emperor  stunned  Fang  Yuan  and  Star   Constellation.</p>
<p>They  did  not  expect  that  someone  would  be  able  to  hide  from  right  under   their  noses.</p>
<p>“This  person  has  a  profound  luck  path  method  on  him,  he  must  be  related  to   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable!”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s   pupils  shrunk  as  the  star  fog  quickly  gathered.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  also  made  his  move  as  he  attacked  Light  Emperor.</p>
<p>Light  Emperor’s  eyes  were  staring  wide  open  as  he  screamed  internally:   ”What  does  this  have  to  do  with  me?!  Why  are  they  attacking  me,  I  was  just   passing  by!”</p>
<p>But  immediately  after,  he  turned  around  and  saw  that  wild  rank  nine  light   Gu  shining  in  white  light,  as  it  came  towards  him  with  You  Tian  Guang.</p>
<p>“I…”  Light  Emperor  wanted  to  cry,  he  understood  the  situation  now.</p>
<p>The  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu  had  an  intense  instinct  for  survival,  it  stayed   with  You  Tian  Guang  because  this  legendary  immemorial  beast  had  a  lot  of</p>
<p>light  path  dao  marks  that  made  it  have  a  familiar  feeling,  there  was  also  the   fact  that  You  Tian  Guang  was  not  strong  enough  to  refine  it.</p>
<p>But  in  the  hands  of  a  venerable,  the  situation  would  be  different!</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  opened  the  only  crack  in  the  star  fog,  he  was  also  a  light   path  cultivator  who  only  had  rank  eight  aura,  the  wild  light  Gu  naturally   came  to  him  as  an  avenue  of  survival.</p>
<p>“Father,  save  me!”  At  the  moment  of  life  and  death,  Light  Emperor  shouted   loudly.</p>
<p>“Son,  don’t  worry.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  flew  towards  them  from   afar,  he  was  getting  closer  rapidly.</p>
<p>Before  he  arrived,  his  killer  move  had  already  appeared,  blocking  Fang   Yuan’s  offensive  method.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  have  enough  thoughts  now,  his  offensive  methods  were   not  as  agile  as  usual,  otherwise,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  would  not   have  such  an  easy  time  blocking  him.</p>
<p>Of  course,  this  was  not  strange  in  the  eyes  of  the  two  venerables.</p>
<p>In  this  fight  between  three  venerables,  it  was  understandable  for  Fang  Yuan   to  save  his  thoughts  in  case  of  emergencies.</p>
<p>After  all,  they  thought  that  he  had  the  least  immortal  essence.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly,  she  had  already   recognized  Light  Emperor  now,  she  immediately  used  the  star  fog  to  pursue   him  and  shorten  the  distance  between  them.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  activated  his  killer  move  again,  golden   aurora  appeared  behind  Light  Emperor  and  blocked  the  star  fog.</p>
<p>“Could  I  have  escaped  on  my  own?  I’m  afraid  that  I  would  have  to  use  rank   nine  light  Gu’s  power  to  get  away  from  them!  Oh  father,  you  almost  did  me   in.”</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  was  a  resolute  person,  thinking  of  this,  he  gritted  his  teeth   and  turned  around,  grabbing  at  You  Tian  Guang.</p>
<p>“If  you  don’t  want  to  die,  come  with  me!”  Light  Emperor  shouted  as  he   brought  You  Tian  Guang  and  the  wild  light  Gu  with  him,  escaping  towards   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>You  Tian  Guang  was  on  the  brink  of  death,  it  was  currently  in  a  stupor  and   unable  to  resist  as  Light  Emperor  brought  it  away  with  him.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  because  they  were  both  light  path  cultivators,  they  were   naturally  close.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  stomped  her  feet  as  her  body  flew   forward  like  a  ray  of  starlight.  Midway,  she  tossed  with  her  hand,  Star   Constellation  Chessboard  flew  out.</p>
<p>At  the  other  end,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  approached  and  opened  his   immortal  aperture’s  entrance,  Luck  Suppression  Heavenly  Palace  flew  out.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Chessboard  had  countless  pieces  shooting  out  like  a   storm.</p>
<p>Luck  Suppression  Heavenly  Palace  sent  out  a  wave-like  golden  aurora  that   shielded  Light  Emperor  and  prevented  him  from  getting  killed  by  those   pieces.</p>
<p>But  a  large  number  of  pieces  still  moved  agilely  as  they  attacked  him.</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  struggled  intensely,  his  expression  was  malevolent.</p>
<p>Facing  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  attacks,  he  dodged  from   side  to  side,  when  he  could  not  evade  some  pieces,  he  would  endure  the   impact.</p>
<p>Thankfully,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  attack  was  already   weakened  by  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  golden  aurora  to  a  large   extent.  Light  Emperor  had  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength  after  all,  he  only   suffered  heavy  injuries  with  blood  flowing  out  of  his  mouth  and  nose,  but   his  speed  remained  the  same.</p>
<p>“Persevere!”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  shouted,  this  situation  was   quite  urgent,  his  son’s  life  was  at  stake,  he  used  his  full  strength  as  a  result.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  gritted  her  teeth,  she  felt  immense   pressure  from  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  who  was  using  his  full   strength.</p>
<p>Seeing  that  Light  Emperor  was  about  to  escape,  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  fought  intensely  while  shouting  at  Fang  Yuan:  ”Great  Love   Immortal  Venerable,  how  long  are  you  going  to  continue  watching?!”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  only  made  some  moves  after  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   appeared,  he  did  not  use  his  full  strength.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  quite  displeased  with  this.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  holding  back  meant  a  huge  threat  to  her.</p>
<p>If  Fang  Yuan  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  were  colluding  now  in  a   set  up  against  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  she  could  not  use  her   full  strength  against  Giant  Sun,  otherwise,  Fang  Yuan  would  sneak  attack   her  while  she  was  unguarded.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  feeling  quite  troubled  now.</p>
<p>He  had  already  done  his  best!</p>
<p>The  refinement  of  heavenly  secret  Gu  had  reached  the  most  difficult  part,   he  had  to  use  a  lot  of  thoughts  and  concentration  on  it.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  excelled  in  the  defensive  aspect  of  wisdom  path,  in  terms  of   thought  production,  he  could  not  match  Star  Constellation  Immortal</p>
<p>Venerable.  But  his  compound  killer  moves  had  a  huge  requirement  for  the   number  of  thoughts.</p>
<p>“Persevere.”  Fang  Yuan  gritted  his  teeth  while  urging  himself  on.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun,  take  this!”  At  the  same  time,  Fang  Yuan  shouted  as  he  flew   towards  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  use  any  offensive  method,  he  only  adjusted  the   movement  killer  move  that  he  had  been  maintaining.</p>
<p>But  simply  this  small  movement  made  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  let  out  a  sigh  of  relief,  while  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   became  alerted.</p>
<p>This  was  because  Fang  Yuan  went  away  from  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  and  approached  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  it  reduced  her   wariness  towards  him.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  also  had  to  save  his  son  from  two   venerables,  he  felt  immense  pressure.</p>
<p>He  shouted  loudly  and  activated  more  trump  card  killer  moves.</p>
<p>For  example,  this  current  method  —  Poor  Luck  Silver  Hook!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  pupils  contracted  as  he  sensed  a  killer  move  approaching,  the   wind-light-fire-lightning  wheels  below  his  feet  rotated  rapidly  as  he   instantly  left  the  area.</p>
<p>At  the  next  moment,  a  pure  silver  curved  hook  appeared  at  the  spot  that  he   was  previously  in.</p>
<p>The  hook  only  appeared  for  a  moment  before  vanishing  again.</p>
<p>It  was  so  fast  it  seemed  like  an  illusion.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  continued  to  move  around  like  a  phantom,  he  did  not  stay  at  the   same  spot  for  more  than  a  breath  of  time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  the  silver  hook  continued  to  appear  at  the  spots  he  went  to,  only   mere  moments  away  from  actually  hitting  him.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  angry  that  Fang  Yuan  was  still   holding  back  now.  He  had  Cooking  Luck  Pot’s  protection  and  could  resist   the  silver  hook  to  attack  Light  Emperor,  but  he  chose  to  dodge  the  attacks,   which  was  what  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  see  because  it   made  Fang  Yuan  easier  to  deal  with.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  know  about  Fang  Yuan’s  true   circumstances  after  all.</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  has  never  used  this  luck  path  killer  move   before,  if  I  get  hit  by  it,  my  luck  will  fall  greatly.  Right  now,  with  the   retaliation  of  all  three  venerables’  luck,  it  would  be  a  detrimental  blow  to   me!”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  a  clear  observation  of  the  situation.</p>
<p>He  could  not  use  offensive  methods  now  because  most  of  his  attention  was   focused  on  the  refinement  of  heavenly  secret  Gu.</p>
<p>But  the  two  venerables  were  hard  to  deceive,  he  was  having  a  hard  time   putting  up  this  show!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  used  various  methods  and  overworked  his  mind,  but  his   thoughts  were  still  falling  to  a  dangerous  level.</p>
<p>Heavenly  secret  Gu’s  refinement  used  too  many  of  his  thoughts,  while  this   battle  was  also  quite  dangerous.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  even  want  to  touch  the  silver  hook.</p>
<p>It  was  as  if  he  was  walking  on  a  tightrope  now!</p>
<p>If  he  was  careless,  he  would  fall  to  a  miserable  death.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  attacked  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable,  relieving  some  of  the  pressure  off  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  was  already  very  close  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  attack  him  but  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  did  everything  to  stop  her.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan!”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  shouted.</p>
<p>“I’ll  take  a  gamble!”  Fang  Yuan’s  eyes  shone  brightly  as  he  expended   nearly  all  his  thoughts  to  take  a  risk  and  activate  reverse  flow  protection   seal.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  flew  forward  with  reverse  flow  protection  seal  like  an  eagle   diving  for  its  food,  he  went  towards  Light  Emperor  with  an  explosive   sound.</p>
<p>“Father,  save  me!”  Light  Emperor  was  shocked  by  Fang  Yuan’s  momentum,   he  screamed  for  help.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  endured  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable’s  attacks  forcefully  and  activated  a  killer  move,  golden  light  shot   towards  Fang  Yuan  like  a  huge  pillar.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  dodge  but  approached  Light  Emperor  instead.</p>
<p>“Trying  to  snatch  an  Immortal  Gu  in  front  of  me?  Die!”  Fang  Yuan   snickered  with  barely  any  thoughts  left  in  his  mind.</p>
<p>Light  Emperor  stared  with  wide  eyes  in  terror,  he  gritted  his  teeth  as  his   body  turned  stiff  as  a  rock.</p>
<p>At  the  crucial  moment,  the  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu  burst  out  with  power.</p>
<p>Blinding  white  light  flashed  in  the  entire  battlefield.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  first  hit  by  the  white  light  before  the  golden  pillar  landed  on   him,  he  crashed  towards  the  ground  like  a  falling  meteor.</p>
<p>Thoughts  were  produced  in  his  mind  and  used  in  the  Gu  refinement,  as  well   as  sustaining  his  defensive  killer  move,  he  could  not  even  use  them  to  think.</p>
<p>After  a  few  breaths  of  time,  reverse  flow  protection  seal  started  to  become   unstable.</p>
<p>If  this  move  broke  now,  not  only  would  Fang  Yuan  suffer  huge  backlash,   the  other  venerables  would  also  notice  his  issue!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  in  critical  danger  now,  if  the  venerables  attacked  him,  he   would  have  no  way  to  resist.</p>
<p>But  this  was  all  within  Fang  Yuan’s  plan.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   were  fighting  over  rank  nine  light  Gu,  they  could  not  afford  to  care  about   Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>With  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  protection,  Light  Emperor  finally   arrived  at  his  father’s  location.</p>
<p>Because  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  attacked  furiously,  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable  suffered  considerable  injuries,  there  was  already   blood  flowing  out  of  his  mouth.</p>
<p>The  two  venerables  faced  off  with  sharp  gazes,  they  collided  in  the  air,  both   sides  were  getting  serious.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  gritted  his  teeth  but  did  not  make  any  rash   move.</p>
<p>He  wanted  to  open  his  immortal  aperture’s  entrance  to  put  Light  Emperor,   the  fainted  You  Tian  Guang,  and  wild  rank  nine  light  Gu  into  his  rank  nine</p>
<p>immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>But  he  knew  that  he  could  not  do  something  like  that  now.</p>
<p>As  time  passed,  inside  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture,  in  Four  Elements   Square  Regret  Blood  Refinement  Pool,  the  hairy  man  Gu  Immortals  were   cheering  loudly.</p>
<p>The  toughest  step  of  refining  heavenly  secret  Gu  was  over,  now,  the   refinement  difficulty  fell  sharply,  it  was  a  smooth  journey  ahead.</p>
<p>The  number  of  thoughts  needed  fell  as  well,  Fang  Yuan  soon  had  enough   thoughts  to  think.</p>
<p>He  immediately  realized  that  he  was  falling,  he  stabilized  his  body  and  flew   towards  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  again.</p>
<p>When  he  saw  that  Light  Emperor  was  standing  beside  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable,  he  became  anxious  and  shouted:  ”We  cannot  let  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  get  rank  nine  light  Gu!  In  the  worst  case,  we  need  to   destroy  it.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly,  he  looked  at  Fang  Yuan  with   deep  killing  intent:  ”Go  ahead  and  attack,  I  will  make  sure  you  pay  a   painful  price.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  silent.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  hastened  the  refinement  of  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu  while   looking  at  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  shouting  with  all  his   might:  ”Star  Constellation,  this  is  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  a  cold  expression,  she  was  very   unhappy  with  Fang  Yuan:  ”If  you  had  used  your  full  strength,  would  we  be   in  this  situation?”</p>
