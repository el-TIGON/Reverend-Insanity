    <p>:  Jiu  Ge  Helps  Spectral  Soul</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Obscured  Heavenly  Secret!</p>
<p>Everything  happened  stealthily.</p>
<p>Only  Fang  Yuan  knew  how  much  immortal  essence  was  used  to  activate   this  rank  nine  killer  move.</p>
<p>Three  hundred  and  sixty  rank  nine  immortal  essence  beads!</p>
<p>After  heavenly  secret  Gu  was  raised  to  rank  nine,  obscured  heavenly  secret   was  also  finally  modified  by  Fang  Yuan,  it  became  a  true  rank  nine  killer   move.</p>
<p>Compared  to  the  rank  eight  obscured  heavenly  secret,  the  rank  nine  version   used  much  more  immortal  essence  and  the  activation  time  was  lengthened   to  over  ten  times  of  before.  In  addition,  the  steps  were  also  six  times  more   complicated,  and  Fang  Yuan  needed  much  more  thoughts  in  the  process.</p>
<p>After  paying  such  a  price,  rank  nine  obscured  heavenly  secret  also  became   much  more  powerful!</p>
<p>It  was  not  a  quantitative  growth  but  a  qualitative  change.</p>
<p>Originally,  rank  eight  obscured  heavenly  secret  killer  move  could  create   temporary  heaven  path  dao  marks  that  resembled  fishing  nets,  they  were   layered  over  each  other  in  a  criss-cross  fashion,  covering  Fang  Yuan’s  entire   body.</p>
<p>It  was  like  how  a  caterpillar  used  its  threads  to  create  a  thick  and  hard   cocoon  around  itself.</p>
<p>Right  now,  although  the  heaven  path  dao  marks  were  still  in  a  fishing  net   form,  they  were  more  tightly  connected  and  were  no  longer  overlapping,  he   only  had  one  simple  layer  around  him.</p>
<p>This  layer  of  heaven  path  dao  marks  were  not  temporary  dao  marks,  they   had  stabilized  into  a  certain  constant  state.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  understood  the  reason  behind  this,  after  observing  closely  and   using  investigative  killer  moves,  he  barely  managed  to  detect  this  layer  of   the  heavenly  secret  fishing  net.</p>
<p>It  was  in  a  state  of  existence  and  non-existence!</p>
<p>The  heavenly  secret  fishing  net  immediately  made  Fang  Yuan  think  of  the   killer  move  that  Thieving  Heaven  Demon  Venerable  left  behind,  ghostly   concealment.</p>
<p>Honestly  speaking,  the  heavenly  secret  fishing  net  was  still  inferior  to   ghostly  concealment.  But  Fang  Yuan  could  sense  that  the  two  had  already   become  similar,  they  shared  a  type  of  special  trait.</p>
<p>Ghostly  concealment  could  last  for  a  long  time  without  expending  immortal   essence.</p>
<p>The  heavenly  secret  fishing  net  was  also  the  same.</p>
<p>But  the  heavenly  secret  fishing  net  could  not  compare  to  ghostly   concealment,  the  reason  was  that  although  it  could  stabilize,  it  could  still  be   consumed.</p>
<p>As  long  as  the  investigative  method  used  on  it  was  strong  enough,  the   heavenly  secret  fishing  net  would  be  expended  while  resisting  it,  as  long  as   the  expenditure  exceeded  the  natural  recovery  speed,  then  the  heavenly   secret  fishing  net  would  start  experiencing  a  deficit,  it  would  be  like  a   sinking  ship  that  got  gradually  submerged.</p>
<p>Of  course,  ghostly  concealment  had  such  a  flaw  too,  but  its  recovery  speed   and  durability  were  much  higher  than  the  heavenly  secret  fishing  net.</p>
<p>Naturally,  the  information  of  Fang  Yuan’s  ghostly  concealment  was  already   known  by  his  enemies,  they  had  created  countermeasures  against  it.</p>
<p>Thus,  ghostly  concealment’s  actual  value  was  much  lower  than  obscured   heavenly  secret.</p>
<p>Even  though  it  was  more  refined  than  obscured  heavenly  secret,  it  was   outdated.</p>
<p>Other  than  the  huge  boost  in  power  of  obscured  heavenly  secret  due  to  the   qualitative  change,  there  was  another  benefit,  the  amount  of  heaven  path   immortal  materials  needed  to  activate  it  had  fallen  greatly,  by  a  total  of   eighty  percent!</p>
<p>The  reduction  in  consumption  of  heaven  path  immortal  materials  was  very   beneficial  to  Fang  Yuan  in  his  attempt  to  accumulate  them.</p>
<p>Heaven  path  immortal  materials  were  not  easy  to  obtain.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  only  gotten  a  good  opportunity  recently  when  the  two   heavens  were  fusing.</p>
<p>In  fact,  the  appearance  of  so  many  heaven  path  immortal  materials  was  also   thanks  to  the  senseless  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable.  This  was  truly  an   extremely  rare  opportunity.</p>
<p>Rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Gu  and  rank  nine  obscured  heavenly  secret  had   many  tactical  implications  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>This  was  an  advancement!</p>
<p>If  the  advancement  failed  and  Fang  Yuan  got  exposed,  he  would  get   attacked  by  the  two  venerables.</p>
<p>It  was  clear  from  how  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  got  targeted  by  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  after  he  took  rank  nine  light  Gu.</p>
<p>She  was  very  overbearing  and  showed  a  tough  stance.</p>
<p>Eventually,  she  only  gave  up  after  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  brought   Light  Emperor  into  Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>If  Fang  Yuan  was  exposed,  everyone  would  see  that  he  had  two  rank  nine   Immortal  Gu!</p>
<p>He  did  not  have  an  impregnable  base  like  Longevity  Heaven  or  Heavenly   Court.</p>
<p>Once  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  cooperated,  they  would  be  very  terrifying!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  wisdom  path  controlled  certainty.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  luck  path  explored  uncertainty.</p>
<p>The  two  were  mutually  conflicting,  but  if  they  worked  together,  they  would   complement  each  other  perfectly.  With  the  potential  of  such  coordination,   even  Fang  Yuan  could  not  stop  them.</p>
<p>After  all,  Fang  Yuan  had  not  created  his  own  rank  nine  offensive  method.</p>
<p>Even  if  Fang  Yuan  could  stop  them,  the  external  situation  of  the  contest  of   three  venerables  would  start  to  emit  pressure  on  him.  He  did  not  have   enough  strength  to  obliterate  Longevity  Heaven  and  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   could  not  be  taken  down,  if  they  deepened  their  cooperation,  it  was  very   likely  that  they  would  become  a  huge  hindrance  to  him.</p>
<p>One  could  say,  if  Fang  Yuan  was  exposed,  he  would  fall  into  an  extremely   passive  state.</p>
<p>But  the  situation  was  fine  now.</p>
<p>With  rank  nine  obscured  heavenly  secret,  he  could  stabilize  the  situation  at   the  critical  moment.</p>
<p>The  refinement  of  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu  was  not  hard,  but   Fang  Yuan  still  had  to  take  a  fatal  risk  to  succeed.</p>
<p>He  succeeded  on  his  first  attempt  at  refining  it,  he  was  quite  fortunate.</p>
<p>This  was  the  turning  point  of  the  contest  of  three  venerables!</p>
<p>Right  now,  Fang  Yuan’s  foundation  in  heaven  path  was  as  such.  He  had   heaven  path  grandmaster  attainment  level,  various  killer  moves  like  heaven   envies  heroic  geniuses,  heavenly  web  protection  veil,  emotionless  heaven   and  earth,  heavenly  summary  earthly  norm,  obscured  heavenly  secret,  and   others,  as  well  as  Immortal  Gu  like  Heavenly  Web,  Heavenly  Secret,   Heaven’s  Envy,  and  Heavenly  Birth.</p>
<p>He  also  had  the  truthful  floating  ice.</p>
<p>At  this  point,  he  had  already  unsealed  over  half  of  the  truthful  floating  ice.</p>
<p>Worth  noting  was  that  after  becoming  a  heaven  path  grandmaster,  his  speed   of  unsealing  the  truthful  floating  ice  also  became  faster!</p>
<p>This  was  easily  understood.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  heaven  path  attainment  level  was  like  a  foundation,  once  it   rose,  he  would  be  able  to  understand  and  comprehend  the  heaven  path   profundities  within  the  truthful  floating  ice  at  a  faster  rate.</p>
<p>Back  then  during  the  battle  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  Paradise  Earth   Immortal  Venerable  obtained  the  truthful  floating  ice  and  unsealed  it   rapidly,  he  almost  became  a  heaven  path  venerable!</p>
<p>“However,  my  heaven  path  attainment  level  only  rose  to  grandmaster  after   using  more  than  half  of  the  truthful  floating  ice.  It  will  be  too  hard  for  me  to   reach  great  grandmaster  using  the  remaining  portion.”</p>
<p>The  higher  the  cultivation  level,  the  greater  the  difference  between  ranks.</p>
<p>This  was  the  same  for  attainment  level.</p>
<p>If  half  of  the  truthful  floating  ice  could  help  Fang  Yuan  go  from  ordinary  to   grandmaster  attainment  level,  then  it  would  be  very  hard  for  the  remaining   half  to  elevate  Fang  Yuan  to  a  great  grandmaster.</p>
<p>Regardless,  Fang  Yuan  was  satisfied.</p>
<p>The  truthful  floating  ice  he  gained  from  Crazed  Demon  Cave  had  been   extremely  useful  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Ignoring  anything  else,  just  the  rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu   recipe  was  something  that  did  not  originally  exist  in  the  world.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  clearly.</p>
<p>This  Immortal  Gu  recipe  was  the  research  result  of  over  a  million  years   through  the  Crazed  Demon  formation  that  Limitless  Demon  Venerable   created,  using  the  chaos  outside  the  world  and  rank  nine  derivation  Gu  as   the  core.</p>
<p>The  concept  was  ahead  of  the  entire  world.</p>
<p>It  was  too  hard  to  achieve  it  on  his  own.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  human  path  attainment  level  was  not  low,  he  was  a   grandmaster.  But  why  did  he  not  try  to  create  rank  six  human  path  Immortal</p>
<p>Gu  recipes?</p>
<p>It  was  too  hard.</p>
<p>Such  an  attempt  would  expend  too  much  of  his  time,  energy,  resources,  and   manpower.  In  fact,  success  was  not  guaranteed.</p>
<p>In  the  current  world,  wild  human  path  Immortal  Gu  were  very  rare.</p>
<p>Creating  a  rank  six  human  path  Immortal  Gu  recipe  was  making  something   that  did  not  exist  in  the  world,  it  was  the  development  of  human  path   beyond  its  current  limit,  it  was  also  pushing  the  current  world  beyond  its   current  boundary  and  limit.</p>
<p>Going  from  zero  to  one  was  like  going  from  nothing  to  something,  this   process  was  very  difficult.</p>
<p>But  from  one  to  two,  the  process  was  just  quantitative  growth,  gradual   development  was  possible  with  much  lower  difficulty.</p>
<p>Rank  six  human  path  Immortal  Gu  recipes  were  very  hard  to  create,  as  for   rank  nine  heavenly  secret  Immortal  Gu’s  recipe,  the  difficulty  was  countless   times  higher!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  was  almost  certain,  this  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  recipe  was  the   most  valuable  part  of  this  largest  piece  of  truthful  floating  ice.</p>
<p>“In  the  following  period,  I  need  to  find  a  chance  to  meet  with  Li  Xiao  Bai   and  secretly  use  obscured  heavenly  secret  on  him.”</p>
<p>Rank  eight  obscured  heavenly  secret  could  deceive  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  the  rank  nine  version   was  even  better.</p>
<p>Of  course,  that  was  under  the  situation  that  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  have  their  own  path’s   rank  nine  Immortal  Gu.</p>
<p>If  there  was  no  opportunity,  he  would  create  one.</p>
<p>But  it  would  be  hard  for  the  two  venerables  to  not  become  suspicious.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  looked  afar  and  cast  his  gaze  on  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>Different  from  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  intention  to  kill,   Fang  Yuan  wanted  to  use  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  as  his  shield  to   conceal  his  true  actions.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  currently  bathed  in  fire.</p>
<p>Under  the  threat  of  survival,  rank  nine  fire  Gu  erupted  with  its  strongest   attack.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  had  been  tortured  for  tens  of  days,  he  was   in  a  state  of  distress.</p>
<p>His  originally  colossal  body  had  already  shrunk  by  thirty  percent.</p>
<p>Although  his  rank  nine  aura  was  still  domineering,  there  was  already  a  hint   of  tiredness.</p>
<p>Only  several  hundred  of  his  countless  thick  black  arms  remained,  while  one   of  his  three  heads  was  burned  to  ashes.</p>
<p>However,  fire  Gu  was  not  longer  as  powerful  as  before,  its  firepower  had   clearly  fallen.</p>
<p>A  rank  eight  Gu  Immortal  slowly  approached  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>“If  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  still  had  his  senses,  he  could  definitely   capture  fire  Gu.  It  is  a  pity  that  he  has  no  sanity  now,  he  cannot  even  isolate   the  natural  essence  of  the  world,  otherwise,  fire  Gu  would  not  have  such   terrifying  power.”</p>
<p>This  Gu  Immortal  had  an  incredibly  deep  gaze,  he  could  comprehend  a   certain  profound  concept  from  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  body.</p>
<p>It  was  Feng  Jiu  Ge!</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  a  soul  beast  army  was  moving  a  hundred  li  away.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  seemed  to  have  sensed  the  soul  beast  army,   his  expression  was  ruthless  as  he  roared  and  flew  to  them.</p>
<p>The  soul  beast  army  was  easily  disoriented  by  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable,  he  opened  his  mouths  and  devoured  them.  In  a  few  breaths  of   time,  he  had  already  eaten  over  ten  thousand  soul  beasts.</p>
<p>These  soul  beasts  immediately  melted  into  soul  path  dao  marks  that  were   transferred  to  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  body.</p>
<p>His  injuries  healed  rapidly,  but  soon,  the  fire  burned  and  created  new   injuries.</p>
<p>“Although  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  has  the  instinct  to  consume,  he   was  just  lucky  to  have  met  a  soul  beast  army,  prolonging  his  struggle.”</p>
<p>“Let  me  lend  you  a  hand  in  that  case.”</p>
<p>Feng  Jiu  Ge  slowly  activated  his  immortal  killer  move  —  Destiny  Song!</p>
<p>His  voice  was  illusory  and  deep,  it  was  filled  with  unique  contradiction.</p>
<p>Initially,  the  song  was  like  a  small  stream  of  water  in  the  mountains,   flowing  slowly.  Gradually,  the  stream  turned  into  flowing  lava  that   expanded  the  river’s  width,  in  the  range  of  mountains,  it  sounded  like  a   dragon’s  roaring  echo.</p>
<p>At  the  same  time,  the  river  of  lava  on  the  mountain  turned  into  a  raging  tide,   swish  swish  swish,  ebb  and  flow,  it  continued  without  stopping.</p>
<p>The  lava  and  waves  collided,  reacting  and  creating  steam  that  covered  the   entire  sky.</p>
<p>The  steam  condensed  into  clouds  that  wanted  to  fly  towards  the  high   heavens.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  lightning  struck  and  thunder  roared,  the  lightning  bolts  landed  on   the  clouds,  the  immortals  felt  like  they  had  fallen  from  the  sky,  they  felt  a   sense  of  hollowness  in  their  hearts.</p>
<p>Phantom  or  real,  high  or  low,  being  proud  and  confident  at  times,  feeling   lost  and  desperate  during  disasters.  Bending  one’s  back  at  times,  spreading   one’s  words  at  times…</p>
<p>Feng  Jiu  Ge’s  expression  soon  turned  pale.</p>
<p>His  current  destiny  song  was  far  stronger  than  before.  In  fact,  his  voice  was   wondrously  beautiful  and  contained  the  essence  of  heaven  and  earth,   clearly,  after  retrieving  the  heavenly  melody,  Feng  Jiu  Ge  had  gained  a  lot   of  insight.</p>
<p>Destiny  song  only  lasted  for  over  ten  breaths  of  time  before  Feng  Jiu  Ge   stopped  using  it  and  retreated.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  still  engulfed  in  terrifying  flames  as  he   growled  in  pain,  it  was  as  if  Feng  Jiu  Ge’s  destiny  song  had  no  effect.</p>
<p>However,  three  days  later.</p>
<p>The  red  flames  on  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  body  went  from   burning  hot  to  an  grey-blue  cold.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  quietened  down  like  an  injured  beast,  he   finally  had  time  to  recuperate.</p>
<p>He  did  not  refine  the  wild  fire  Gu,  while  fire  Gu  also  stopped  attacking  and   resisting  him.  Inside  his  body,  a  certain  intricate  relationship  was  formed  as   they  started  helping  each  other!</p>
<p>Puff,  huff,  puff……</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  breathing  became  slower  as  the  huge   grey-blue  fire  around  him  became  dimmer,  until  it  was  completely  gone.</p>
<p>His  entire  body  was  like  a  gravestone,  he  gave  off  an  endless  aura  of  death   accompanied  by  an  icy  chill.</p>
<p>Then,  at  the  next  moment!</p>
<p>Rumble!</p>
<p>Flames  surged  and  burst  out  over  several  thousand  li,  quickly  spreading   throughout  the  area  in  all  directions.</p>
<p>Everywhere  it  went,  living  beings  crumbled,  they  broke  down  and  burned   into  ashes  as  their  soul  essence  was  rapidly  absorbed  by  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable,  it  was  as  if  they  were  returning  to  the  source.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  injuries  healed  quickly,  his  body  also   started  to  expand  at  an  observable rate.</p>
