        <p>:  Nothing  is  Certain  Except  Success</p>
<p>Ever  since  the  sun  was  destroyed,  five  regions  and  two  heavens  fell  into   deep  darkness.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  who  was  burning  with  blue,  eerie  fire  could   never  replace  the  sun.  Because  what  he  gave  the  world  were  not  vitality  and   warmth,  but  coldness  and  killing  intent.</p>
<p>In  this  darkness,  the  countless  stars  shining  in  the  sky  of  Central  Continent   became  a  consolation  for  the  mortals.</p>
<p>However,  right  now,  these  dazzling  starlights  were  being  attacked!</p>
<p>Vast  and  surging  qi  currents  submerged  the  boundless  starlight.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  waved  his  sleeves  as  he  slowly  flew  in  the  air  and   continued  his  attacks  with  an  indifferent  expression.</p>
<p>He  was  one  of  the  arrangements  Fang  Yuan  made  when  he  deployed  troops   before.  Right  now,  he  immediately  acted  after  receiving  the  main  body’s   message.</p>
<p>The  space  inside  star  array  calculation  formation  was  in  an  uproar.</p>
<p>There  were  many  Gu  Immortals  stationed  here.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  arranged  many  Gu  Immortals  here   because  star  array  calculation  formation  was  fragile.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  aware  that  star  array  calculation   formation  which  was  constructed  in  just  a  short  period  was  Heavenly   Court’s  weakness  and  would  become  other  venerables’  target.</p>
<p>So  she  also  left  Embroidered  Tower  and  Star  Constellation  Chessboard  in   this  formation!</p>
<p>“Qi  Sea  Ancestor  appeared  at  the  northeast  side,  he  extinguished  three   thousand  eight  hundred  and  seventy-one  stars  with  one  move.”</p>
<p>“Urgent  report!  Fang  Yuan’s  enslavement  path  clone  Wu  Shuai  appeared  at   the  northwest  side  and  destroyed  two  thousand  six  hundred  and  sixty-four   stars.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  inside  Embroidered  Tower  was  just  about  to  send   orders  when  the  whole  formation  space  shook  fiercely.</p>
<p>She  then  heard  the  Gu  Immortals  in  charge  of  information  shout  in  panic:   ”Zhan  Bu  Du,  Zhan  Bu  Du  appeared!  He  is  attacking  from  the  south  and  is   coming  straight  towards  us!”</p>
<p>“Zhan  Bu  Du?”  Star  Constellation’s  will  immediately  controlled  her   thoughts  to  take  a  look  through  the  star  array  calculation  formation.  She   saw  a  bright-looking  young  man  wearing  a  large  blood-red  cape.  His   momentum  was  like  a  tiger  coming  out  of  the  mountain  or  a  mad  dragon   descending  upon  the  world,  his  attacks  produced  explosive  sounds  as  he   moved  forward.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  sighed.</p>
<p>There  were  already  clues  from  Fang  clan’s  situation  about  Fang  Yuan  being   able  to  revive  Gu  Immortals.  Zhan  Bu  Du’s  revival  did  not  surprise  Star   Constellation’s  will.</p>
<p>But  she  was  a  bit  troubled  in  this  situation.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  Zhan  Bu  Du  had  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength   while  Wu  Shuai  was  a  peak  rank  eight  expert.  In  this  aspect,  Heavenly</p>
<p>Court  lacked  elite  experts  that  could  match  them.</p>
<p>Qing  Chou  could  be  considered  one  but  was  guarding  Divine  Emperor  City   at  this  moment.  Based  on  strategical  importance,  Divine  Emperor  City  was   much  more  important  than  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>As  for  Qin  Ding  Ling,  Che  Wei,  and  the  rest,  they  were  experts  among  rank   eights  but  were  still  lacking  compared  to  Qi  Sea  and  Zhan  Bu  Du.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan  can  revive  Gu  Immortals  while  preserving  their  cultivation   level.  If  so,  where  are  his  variant  human  rank  eight  subordinates  hiding   now?</p>
<p>The  situation  was  not  clear,  Star  Constellation’s  will  decided  to  play  it  safe   and  prioritize  defending  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  personally  controlled  star  array  calculation   formation;  in  an  instant,  dazzling  starlight  shone.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  Wu  Shuai  had  to  close  their  eyes  and  use  investigative   killer  moves.  Only  Zhan  Bu  Du  who  had  a  very  strong  body  opened  his   eyes  wide  without  any  worries.</p>
<p>Starlight  dimmed  quickly,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  Wu  Shuai,  and  Zhan  Bu  Du’s   vision  changed  suddenly,  they  found  themselves  on  a  large  chessboard.</p>
<p>“This  is…  Star  Constellation  Chessboard?”</p>
<p>“Hmph!  This  star  array  calculation  formation  and  Star  Constellation   Chessboard  can  mutually  support  each  other.”</p>
<p>“Not  only  this,  it  probably  has  Embroidered  Tower’s  help  as  well!”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones  conversed  secretly  while  attacking  madly.</p>
<p>Explosions  rang,  star  array  calculation  formation  shook  intensely  but  it  was   able  to  barely  hold  on  with  the  help  of  Embroidered  Tower  and  Star</p>
<p>Constellation  Chessboard.</p>
<p>“This  is  not  good,  if  the  situation  falls  into  a  stalemate,  how  can  we  help  our   main  body  pressure  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable?”  Qi  Sea   Ancestor’s  heart  sank  slightly.</p>
<p>The  other  two  knew  this  was  not  good  and  strengthened  their  attacks.</p>
<p>Spectral  heaven.</p>
<p>The  fight  of  the  four  venerables  was  continuing.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  clones  made  a  move  but  were  blocked  by  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  arrangements.  However,  Fang  Yuan’s  situation  was   improving  quickly.</p>
<p>His  situation  was  troubling  earlier  because  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   used  his  full  strength.</p>
<p>But  the  situation  was  changing  now  because  of  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  as  well.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  battle  strength  was  falling  constantly.</p>
<p>Although  the  killer  move—I  reside  in  all  living  beings  and  heaven  and  earth —was  very  strong,  it  forcibly  extracted  external  luck.  It  was  like  a  rootless   tree  or  a  sourceless  body  of  water;  the  more  it  was  used,  the  less  would   remain.</p>
<p>Not  only  this,  when  the  effect  of  this  move  dissipate  completely,  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable’s  luck  would  fall  into  a  weakened  state  which  would   last  for  a  while  before  it  goes  back  to  normal.</p>
<p>The  news  of  star  array  calculation  formation  being  attacked  was  already   known  by  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  at  the  very  first  moment.</p>
<p>But  she  could  not  go  back  to  reinforce  it.</p>
<p>The  moment  she  did  that,  she  would  fall  into  Fang  Yuan’s  trap.  At  that  time,   why  would  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  be  willing  to  fight  against   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  Fang  Yuan  alone?</p>
<p>If  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  blindly  cared  about  Heavenly   Court’s  benefits,  it  would  definitely  put  a  crack  in  the  two  venerables’   alliance.  After  all,  Giant  Sun  was  not  a  Heavenly  Court  venerable,  he  did   not  share  the  same  sentiments  as  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,   this  alliance  was  just  because  of  the  situation.</p>
<p>In  fact,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  suspected  that  if  she  were  to   go  back  to  reinforce  Central  Continent,  Fang  Yuan  would  give  chase.</p>
<p>Among  the  venerables,  only  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  could   pose  a  threat  to  Meng  Qiu  Zhen.  Fang  Yuan  would  directly  bring  the   battlefield  to  Central  Continent  which  was  even  more  harmful  to  Central   Continent.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  defended  against  Fang  Yuan’s   constant  interference  while  inwardly  sighing  at  his  craftiness  and   understanding  of  the  human  heart,  choosing  a  perfect  time  for  his  clones  to   make  a  move.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  also  tried  using  other  killer  moves  to   attack  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Although  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  strong,  he  had  lost  his  senses   and  was  only  an  annoyance.  Fang  Yuan  was  still  the  crucial  factor  and  the   biggest  threat!</p>
<p>But  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  constant  attempts  showed  no   visible  effects.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  used  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  to  protect  himself,  his   battle  tactic  was  shallow  but  it  had  an  excellent  effect.</p>
<p>The  four  venerables’  chaotic  battle  lasted  for  a  while  longer.  Seeing  that  ’I   reside  in  all  living  beings  and  heaven  and  earth’  killer  move  was  decreasing</p>
<p>in  effect,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  no  choice  but  to  activate  this   move  again.</p>
<p>In  an  instant,  golden  light  pillar  appeared  once  again.  It  spanned  across   heaven  and  earth,  it  was  grand,  magnificent,  and  extremely  dazzling.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  luck  strengthened  once  again  and  his  battle   strength  rose  to  the  previous  state.</p>
<p>I  reside  in  all  living  beings  and  heaven  and  earth  killer  move  could  be  used   continuously  but  its  after-effects  would  increase  subsequently.  Right  now,   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  in  a  position  from  which  he  could  not   retreat,  his  whole  combat  system  was  based  on  his  positive  luck.  If  his  luck   was  low,  his  battle  strength  would  reduced  significantly.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  naturally  did  not  want  to  reveal  the  flaw  of   this  move  when  he  was  using  it  for  the  first  time.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  saw  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  aura  rising  again,  he   immediately  retreated  and  used  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  as  a  shield   to  block  the  attacks.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  clenched  his  teeth  in  hatred  as  he  saw  Fang   Yuan’s  action.</p>
<p>He  knew  that  if  he  did  not  do  something,  the  previous  situation  would   replay,  so  he  immediately  used  another  trump  card.</p>
<p>Luck  path  killer  move  —  Nothing  is  Certain  Except  Success!</p>
<p>Golden  light  flickered  on  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  body.  The  golden   light  slowly  rose  above  his  head  and  turned  into  an  amber  jade  sphere.</p>
<p>The  amber  jade  sphere’s  aura  was  extremely  powerful,  even  Fang  Yuan  and   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  felt  their  hearts  palpitate.</p>
<p>Next,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  gave  a  low  shout  and  fiercely  struck   the  amber  jade  sphere  with  his  head.</p>
<p>The  amber  jade  sphere  shot  off  towards  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  how  terrifying  this  move  was  when  he  saw  that  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable’s  surging  luck  had  mostly  dissipated  and  nearly  went   back  to  its  original  state.</p>
<p>He  could  not  immediately  decipher  the  profundities  in  this  move  so  he  did   not  take  this  move  head-on,  instead  dodging  behind  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  had  no  fear  as  he  swatted  the  amber  jade   sphere  far  away  with  one  hand.</p>
<p>The  amber  jade  sphere  was  like  a  ball  that  directly  fell  from  spectral   heaven.</p>
<p>“What?”  Fang  Yuan  and  Star  Constellation  were  slightly  astonished.</p>
<p>This  move  had  such  a  terrifying  aura  but  it  was  actually  suppressed  so   easily?</p>
<p>“Giant  Sun…”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  directly  expressed   her  concern.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  smiled,  replying  confidently:  ”Star   Constellation,  please  watch.  This  move  is  extraordinarily  profound.  It  is   created  using  self  luck,  all  living  being’s  luck,  and  heaven  and  earth  luck.  It   is  not  restricted  by  the  usual  concept  of  offense  and  defense  but  uses  the   variables  in  heaven  and  earth  and  all  living  beings  to  form  a  result  that  will   astonish  both  of  us.  It  is  just  that  this  move  needs  some  time  to  show  its   power.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  heard  this  reply  and  immediately   asked  the  crucial  question:  ”Then  how  long  does  it  need  to  show  an  effect?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  expression  stiffened:  ”The  time  is…  not   fixed.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable:  ”…”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  continued:  ”This  move  has  already  been   used,  you  don’t  need  to  worry  about  it.  Why  don’t  you  attack  Fang  Yuan   with  me?”</p>
<p>He  then  pounced  at  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  glanced  at  the  amber  jade  sphere   before  coordinating  with  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  as  they  flew  around   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  and  attacked  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>The  amber  jade  sphere  encountered  a  large  soul  beast  army  on  its  descent.   After  piercing  through  hundreds  of  soul  beasts,  its  aura  fell  by  ten  percent   and  its  direction  also  changed  slightly.</p>
<p>It  continued  to  fall,  its  aura  dropping  by  another  ten  percent  as  it  pierced   through  the  heavenly  wind  qi  wall.  After  it  reached  the  sky  of  Central   Continent,  it  directly  shot  into  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  was  controlling  Star  Constellation  Chessboard  and   star  array  calculation  formation  to  deal  with  Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones.</p>
<p>The  two  sides  were  still  in  a  stalemate  when  suddenly,  the  luck  path  killer   move  that  looked  like  an  amber  egg  intruded  the  inside  of  the  starry   chessboard.</p>
<p>“What  is  this?!”  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  the  group  were  immediately  vigilant.</p>
<p>“Oh  no.”  Star  Constellation’s  will’s  expression  changed  intensely.</p>
<p>Be  it  star  array  calculation  formation  or  Star  Constellation  Chessboard,  they   were  both  wisdom  path  methods  characterized  by  delicate  and  complicated   calculations.</p>
<p>But  the  amber  jade  sphere  was  the  congregation  of  luck  path,  it  was  a  huge   variable.</p>
<p>The  amber  jade  sphere  entered  Star  Constellation  Chessboard  and   immediately  disturbed  the  whole  battlefield.  It  continuously  absorbed  and   repelled  all  kinds  of  arrangements  made  by  Star  Constellation’s  will,   making  everything  turn  chaotic.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation’s  will  quickly  tried  to  suppress  the  variables  and  maintain   the  battlefield  but  she  could  not  avoid  showing  certain  loopholes  as  a  result.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  three  clones  were  joyous  and  immediately  grabbed  this  chance   to  attack  the  loopholes.</p>
<p>A  while  later.</p>
<p>There  was  a  huge  explosion.  The  vision  of  Fang  Yuan’s  clones  changed   suddenly  as  they  reappeared  in  the  sky  above  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>A  small  portion  of  Star  Constellation  Chessboard  was  destroyed  and  Star   Constellation’s  will  immediately  stored  it  in  Embroidered  Tower.</p>
