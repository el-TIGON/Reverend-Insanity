        <p>:  Qi  Sea’s  Divine  Might</p>
<p>“What  a  scheme,  Fang  Yuan!”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  expression  looked  unsightly.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  move  was  extremely  ingenious.</p>
<p>He  took  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  to  Central  Continent,  forcing  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  into  a  dilemma.</p>
<p>If  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  continued  to  fight  Spectral  Soul   Demon  Venerable,  Fang  Yuan  would  take  the  chance  to  open  his  immortal   aperture  and  put  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  inside  before  wreaking  havoc  in  Central   Continent.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  was  already  in  a  dangerous  situation,  the  star  array   calculation  formation  was  in  an  extremely  damaged  state  with  eighty   percent  of  it  destroyed.  Divine  Emperor  City  was  being  attacked  by  Shen   Shang  and  Lu  Wei  Yin,  it  was  already  showing  signs  of  being  unable  to   maintain  the  two  human  path  killer  moves.</p>
<p>If  Fang  Yuan  attacked  in  this  situation,  he  would  definitely  create  an   unimaginable  massacre  in  Central  Continent  and  Heavenly  Court!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  worthy  of  being  the  number  one   person  in  wisdom  path,  she  made  a  decision  almost  immediately.</p>
<p>She  sighed  and  said  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable:  ”Fang  Yuan  is   extremely  crafty,  he  wants  to  use  this  way  to  protect  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable!  We  cannot  fall  for  his  trap!  I  will  go  chase  him  and  not  let  him   get  any  chance  to  put  his  clone  back  in  his  aperture.  Giant  Sun,  I  hope  you   can  kill  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  knew  in  his  heart:  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  clearly  knew  this  was  Fang  Yuan’s  scheme  but  she  had   to  fall  into  it.  It  was  true  that  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was   going  to  make  things  difficult  for  Fang  Yuan,  but  it  was  even  more  true  that   she  was  going  back  to  defend  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>But  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  argue.</p>
<p>If  it  were  him,  he  would  also  be  willing  to  fall  into  the  scheme  to  protect  his   Huang  Jin  bloodline.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  nodded,  saying  decisively:  ”Today,  either   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  or  Fang  Yuan  must  die!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  cooperation  made  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  let  out  a  sigh  of  relief.</p>
<p>At  the  crucial  moment,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  made  a  clear  and   sensible  decision!</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  immediately  chased  after  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Within  the  star  array  calculation  formation’s  inner  space.</p>
<p>Demon  Judgment  Board  was  sent  flying.</p>
<p>Inside  Demon  Judgment  Board,  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  and  Red  Heart   Traveler  were  sweating  heavily,  their  faces  turned  pale  with  a  sense  of   trepidation.</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  the  previous  owner  and  the  current  owner  of  Demon   Judgment  Board  had  joined  hands!</p>
<p>But  they  were  still  in  a  disadvantage.</p>
<p>What  forced  Demon  Judgment  Board  to  retreat  time  and  again?</p>
<p>“Careful,  he  is  coming  again!”  Red  Heart  Traveler  who  was  mainly   responsible  for  controlling  Demon  Judgment  Board  reminded  suddenly.</p>
<p>Zhan  Bu  Du’s  cape  fluttered  fiercely  as  he  flew  closer.</p>
<p>After  he  activated  incomplete  freedom  transformation,  he  was  a  genuine   human-shaped  beast.  Even  Demon  Judgment  Board  was  not  able  to   properly  take  a  hit  from  him.</p>
<p>Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  received  Red  Heart  Traveler’s  reminder,  he  felt  a   quiver  and  shouted  frantically:  ”Let’s  try  again!”</p>
<p>Demon  Judgment  Board  let  out  waves  of  blood  light.</p>
<p>The  blood  light  was  like  a  tide  that  quickly  spread  thousands  of  feet.  The   scarlet-red  blood  light  contained  endless  coldness.</p>
<p>Zhan  Bu  Du  had  to  charge  into  the  blood  light  to  near  Demon  Judgment   Board.  His  movement  inevitably  slowed  down.</p>
<p>“This  move  again.”  Zhan  Bu  Du’s  expression  turned  somewhat  strange.</p>
<p>He  had  already  been  obstructed  by  this  blood  path  killer  move  three  times   in  a  row.</p>
<p>Demon  Judgment  Board  used  the  time  when  Zhan  Bu  Du  had  slowed  down   to  retreat  to  a  safe  distance.</p>
<p>And  the  one  who  accomplished  this  was  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng.</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  looked  at  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  with  gratitude  and   admiration.  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  had  activated  blood  turns  cold  killer  move   but  he  had  connected  this  move  to  Demon  Judgment  Board  so  closely  that  it   felt  like  blood  turns  cold  was  Demon  Judgment  Board’s  killer  move.</p>
<p>This  was  an  extremely  ingenious  pioneering  work,  none  of  the  past  owners   of  Demon  Judgment  Board  accomplished  this.</p>
<p>Speaking  of  which,  Red  Heart  Traveler  was  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng’s  master.</p>
<p>But  he  did  not  accept  the  disciple  voluntarily,  it  was  mainly  because  of  the   orders  from  higher-ups  and  his  own  benefits.  So,  Red  Heart  Traveler’s   perception  of  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng  had  always  been  poor  and  did  not  have   much  affection  for  this  disciple.</p>
<p>But  now,  Red  Heart  Traveler’s  impression  of  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng   underwent  a  huge  change.</p>
<p>“It  was  not  a  mistake  to  hand  Demon  Judgment  Board  over  to  you.  Fang   Zheng,  you  have  to  work  harder  in  the  future.”  Red  Heart  Traveler   encouraged.</p>
<p>“Oh,  yes,  I  will  engrave  master’s  words  in  my  heart.”  Gu  Yue  Fang  Zheng   was  somewhat  surprised  before  saying  with  a  sigh,  ”I  came  in  touch  with   the  essence  of  painting  path  when  I  entered  derivation  formation,  which   allowed  me  to  modify  blood  turns  cold  killer  move.  Its  might  is  amplified   through  Demon  Judgment  Board  and  is  able  to  freeze  the  blood  of  rank   eight  Gu  Immortal  experts  and  kill  them.  But  against  Zhan  Bu  Du,  it  can   only  obstruct  him  for  a  short  while.”</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  shook  his  head,  advising:  ”It  is  not  that  you  are  not   excellent  but  the  enemy  is  too  strong.  He…  is  one  of  the  strongest  clones  of   Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  after  all!”</p>
<p>When  he  heard  the  mention  of  his  big  brother  Gu  Yue  Fang  Yuan,  Fang   Zheng  heaved  a  deep  sigh.</p>
<p>“Alright,  we  must  keep  on  pestering  Zhan  Bu  Du  and  not  let  him  destroy   the  whole  formation  space  easily.”  Red  Heart  Traveler  could  not  hide  his   worries  when  he  said  this,  ”Sigh,  if  we  really  were  to  talk  of  it,  Heaven   Refining  Demon  Venerable’s  strongest  clone  is  Qi  Sea  Ancestor.  I  hope   Lady  Qin  Ding  Ling  can  stall  him.”</p>
<p>Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>The  star  array  calculation  formation’s  bases  were  set  up  in  the  two  heavens’   grotto-heavens;  right  now,  there  were  almost  none  of  these  grotto-heavens   remaining.</p>
<p>Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  was  the  last  pillar  remaining!</p>
<p>Qi  currents  gushed  out  like  an  ocean  swarming  the  sky  as  Qi  Sea  Ancestor   who  was  standing  high  in  the  sky  looked  down  at  everyone.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor,  Duke  Mei,  Duke  Tong,  and  the  rest  were  either  controlling   Immortal  Gu  Houses  or  floating  alone  in  the  air  as  they  looked  up  at  Qi  Sea   Ancestor  with  an  extremely  solemn  expression.</p>
<p>In  this  fight,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  showed  the  strongest  battle  strength  among  all   the  existing  pseudo  venerables!</p>
<p>Especially  Hu  elevation,  once  it  was  activated,  it  could  forcibly  break  a   grotto-heaven  and  no  one  was  able  to  block  it.</p>
<p>Be  it  Qin  Ding  Ling’s  luck  path,  Che  Wei’s  weapon  path,  or  the  senior   Heavenly  Court  experts  like  Duke  Mei  and  Duke  Tong  fighting  without   caring  for  their  lives,  or  even  the  continuous  harassment  by  experts  like   Zhou  Xiong  Xin  and  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy,  they  could  not  stop  Qi  Sea   Ancestor  from  destroying  the  star  array  calculation  formation.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Nine  Essence  Jade  Dew  Pill.</p>
<p>Ruan  Dan  was  constantly  activating  pill  path  killer  moves  to  heal  the   Heavenly  Court  immortals.</p>
<p>He  also  had  a  move  called  life  sustaining  small  revival  pill  which  could   forcibly  prolong  the  life  of  others  if  they  were  hit  by  a  fatal  attack.</p>
<p>These  were  the  gains  he  made  in  derivation  formation.</p>
<p>If  not  for  Ruan  Dan’s  spectacular  performance  in  this  battle,  Heavenly   Court’s  Gu  Immortals  could  not  have  lasted  for  so  long.</p>
<p>Be  it  Ruan  Dan  or  other  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals,  all  of  them  had   made  progress.  However,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  had  become  much  stronger,   almost  comparable  to  Duke  Long  at  his  final  moment  in  the  fate  war!</p>
<p>Qi  currents  billowed  as  they  turned  into  tens  of  thousands  of  giant  dragons.   They  then  dispersed  and  attacked  Profound  Literature  grotto-heaven  from   all  directions,  ignoring  Heavenly  Court’s  immortals.</p>
<p>Old  Immortal  Hua  Yu  cried  out  in  sadness:  ”Lord  Fang  Yuan,  are  you  really   going  to  exterminate  everyone?!”</p>
<p>His  tears  started  falling.</p>
<p>Duke  Tong  shouted:  ”Everyone,  don’t  be  shaken,  don’t  risk  yourselves  in   saving  the  mortals.  This  demon  is  trying  to  use  our  sympathy  to  influence   our  rational  decision-making.  Once  our  forces  are  split,  we  will  definitely   fall  apart  in  his  hands!”</p>
<p>“It  is  our  turn  now.”  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  suddenly   transmitted  his  voice  to  Shabi  Ninety-five.</p>
<p>“Master,  you  want  to  use  that  move?  But  we  are  not  proficient  in  it  yet.”</p>
<p>“There  is  no  other  option,  we  need  to  give  it  a  try.  We  must  pressure  and   disturb  Qi  Sea  Ancestor;  otherwise,  if  he  gets  a  chance,  he  will  use  Hu   elevation  killer  move  again.”  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  activated   the  killer  move.</p>
<p>Shabi  Ninety-five  took  a  deep  breath  and  followed  up  by  activating  its  Gu   worms.</p>
<p>Their  aura  linked  together;  Shabi  Ninety-five  turned  into  a  vast  lump  of  qi   that  poured  into  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch.</p>
<p>Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  who  had  a  round  head  and  large  ears   breathed  in  the  vast  qi  through  his  nose  and  mouth,  his  body  expanding   rapidly.</p>
<p>When  he  absorbed  all  the  qi  in  his  body,  he  transformed  into  a  huge  giant.</p>
<p>The  giant  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  slammed  into  the  sky-covering   qi  sea,  stirring  up  the  boundless  qi  currents;  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  body  shook   and  almost  lost  control  of  the  qi  sea.</p>
<p>Inside  the  qi  sea,  the  giant  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  started   sucking  in  the  qi  currents  crazily.</p>
<p>The  qi  sea’s  size  continued  to  shrink.</p>
<p>“We  need  to  act  fast.”</p>
<p>“Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  is  using  Shabi  Ninety-five’s  special   characteristic  to  absorb  all  the  foreign  qi.  He  cannot  hold  on  for  long,  once   the  absorbed  qi  currents  reach  the  limit,  he  will  explode  and  die!”</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  knew  the  details  of  this  move  and  acted   quickly.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  besieged  from  all  sides,  he  pushed  his  palms  to  raise  a   thousand  feet  tall  qi  wall  to  stop  Heavenly  Court’s  attacks.</p>
<p>He  then  slashed  down  with  one  arm;  qi  blades  appeared  from  thin  air  and   cut  Duke  Tong  and  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy,  making  them  cough  blood  and   retreat.</p>
<p>Qi  currents  became  vast  and  grand,  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  was  about  to  continue   his  attack  but  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  started  absorbing  without   any  regards  for  his  life;  the  qi  currents  became  listless  again.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  snorted  coldly,  using  yin-yang  great  killer  hands  to  send   Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch  flying  like  a  ball.</p>
<p>He  used  divine  flick  to  flick  at  Qin  Ding  Ling,  Che  Wei,  Old  Immortal  Hua   Yu,  and  Zhou  Xiong  Xin,  easily  forcing  them  back.</p>
<p>Jun  Shen  Guang  was  extremely  fast  and  sent  a  killer  move  at  Qi  Sea   Ancestor  again  but  was  blocked  by  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  defensive  methods.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Orchid  Breath.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  injuries  were  healed  rapidly.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Qi  Engulfing  Mountains  and  Rivers!</p>
<p>This  was  a  killer  move  within  Primordial  Origin  true  inheritance,  it  was   modified  by  Qi  Sea  Ancestor  and  had  its  activation  speed  increased  by   more  than  twice.</p>
<p>Seven  Fiendish  Primeval  Monarch,  Duke  Tong,  Seven  Fiendish  Primeval   Monarch,  and  the  rest  who  were  still  counterattacking  shook  intensely  and   fell  from  the  sky.</p>
<p>In  the  chaotic  battle,  Wan  Zi  Hong,  Prince  Feng  Xian,  Bai  Cang  Shui,  and   Uncle  Feng  occupied  the  east,  south,  north,  and  west  directions,  trapping  Qi   Sea  Ancestor  at  the  center.</p>
<p>Immortal  killer  move  —  Earth  Water  Wood  Fire  Four  Elements  Shifting   Formation!</p>
<p>This  was  not  an  ordinary  killer  move  but  an  ancient  battle  formation.  This   formation  required  four  rank  eight  Gu  Immortals,  there  could  not  be  one   more  or  one  less.</p>
<p>Not  only  this,  the  four  Gu  Immortals  had  to  cultivate  earth  path,  water  path,   wood  path,  and  fire  path  respectively.</p>
<p>The  killer  move  activated  successfully.  Wan  Zi  Hong,  Prince  Feng  Xian,   Bai  Cang  Shui,  and  Uncle  Feng  were  covered  in  armor  that  shone  with</p>
<p>green,  red,  black,  or  yellow  radiance.</p>
<p>The  four  colors  spread  quickly  and  linked  together,  showing  a  sign  of   transforming  into  a  battlefield  killer  move!</p>
<p>“Hmm?”  Qi  Sea  Ancestor’s  expression  shook  slightly  as  he  revealed  a  trace   of  admiration.</p>
<p>This  move  was  a  new  innovation  and  was  already  vaguely  reaching  a  whole   new  realm.</p>
<p>It  was  not  only  an  ancient  battle  formation  but  also  a  battlefield  killer  move!</p>
<p>“We  must  trap  him!”</p>
<p>“We  cannot  relax.”</p>
<p>“Success  depends  on  this!!”</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  immortals  roused  themselves.</p>
<p>Qi  Sea  Ancestor  laughed  heartily:  ”It  is  a  good  move  indeed.”</p>
<p>The  moment  he  finished  speaking,  a  figure  descended  from  the  sky.</p>
<p>The  immortals’  expressions  changed.</p>
