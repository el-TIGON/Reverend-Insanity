    <p>:  Two  Venerables  Fight  Against</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan</p>
<p>Ever  since  Fang  Yuan  suddenly  flew  into  spectral  heaven,  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  had  been  paying  close  attention  to  this  place.</p>
<p>When  Fang  Yuan  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  fought,  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  happy  at  first.  After  all,  the  two  venerables   expending  each  other’s  resources  was  most  beneficial  to  him.</p>
<p>But  shortly  after,  he  was  faintly  worried  about  Fang  Yuan  not  being  able  to   withstand  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  attacks  and  getting   defeated  too  early.</p>
<p>“If  Fang  Yuan  can’t  continue,  I  will  help  him  a  bit.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  had  been  secretly  preparing  to  help  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>He  naturally  did  not  have  good  intentions.</p>
<p>First,  Fang  Yuan  being  in  a  weaker  position  was  not  beneficial  to  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable.  As  far  as  he  was  concerned,  Heavenly  Court  was  still   the  biggest  enemy.</p>
<p>Second,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  still  wanted  Fang  Yuan  and  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  continue  wearing  each  other  down,  so</p>
<p>he  needed  to  help  Fang  Yuan  to  maintain  the  battle  of  attrition  between  the   two  venerables  to  gain  the  most  benefits.</p>
<p>“I  have  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  after  all,  my  immortal  essence  can  be   replenished  greatly.  Consuming  some  immortal  essence  in  battle  is  more   detrimental  for  them!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  this  thought  back  then.</p>
<p>He  was  not  wrong.</p>
<p>It  was  also  very  reasonable.</p>
<p>It  was  just  that  he  did  not  know  the  truth.</p>
<p>He  only  possessed  the  information  that  he  could  obtain.</p>
<p>But  soon,  he  was  shocked  to  see  that  in  the  battle  between  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Fang  Yuan,  it  was  Fang  Yuan  who   had  the  upper  hand!</p>
<p>He  had  not  expected  this.</p>
<p>After  all,  in  his  impression,  Fang  Yuan  was  behind  on  refining  dao  marks,   although  he  had  potential,  his  immortal  essence  reserve  was  the  worst.</p>
<p>How  could  he  gain  the  upper  hand?</p>
<p>He  even  made  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  take  the  initiative  to   ask  for  help  from  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable!</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  witnessed  the  whole  fight,  after  the   surprise,  he  felt  that  it  made  sense.</p>
<p>Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound  left  an   extremely  deep  impression  on  him.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  used  Dang  Hun  Mountain  as  the  core  to  create  such  a  powerful   killer  move  that  destroyed  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s</p>
<p>incomplete  combat  system.</p>
<p>It  made  sense  for  Fang  Yuan  to  be  victorious.</p>
<p>When  Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound   showed  its  might,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  actually  not  too   anxious,  instead,  he  became  a  little  relieved  and  no  longer  felt  such  an  urge   to  probe  Fang  Yuan’s  foundation.</p>
<p>The  reason?</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  lacked  immortal  essence  and  was  the  slowest  one  at  refining   natural  dao  marks,  what  did  he  spend  the  rest  of  his  time  on?</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  understood  now.</p>
<p>“So  he  used  his  time  to  deduce  killer  moves.”</p>
<p>This  was  a  rather  correct  choice  in  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  opinion.</p>
<p>He  was  even  more  at  ease  because  the  killer  move  used  a  secluded  domain   of  heaven  and  earth  as  the  core.</p>
<p>“Looks  like  Fang  Yuan  does  not  have  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,  so  he  used  a   secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth  to  create  a  quasi-rank  nine  killer   move.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  could  not  help  feeling  envious.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  the  most  number  of  secluded  domains  of  heaven  and  earth,   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  also  had  several,  but  he,  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable,  only  had  one  and  it  was  incomplete.</p>
<p>He  really  wanted  to  have  a  complete  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth!</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  observing  the  battle  quietly,  when  he   saw  Fang  Yuan  gaining  the  upper  hand  with  Shocking  Departure  of  Year   Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound  killer  move,  his  mind  turned  calm.</p>
<p>However,  when  he  saw  Fang  Yuan  withstanding  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable’s  Mental  Domain’s  killer  move,  he  could  no  longer  sit   still.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  already  expected  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  to  use  a  wisdom  path  killer  move  with  Mental  Domain   as  the  core.</p>
<p>But  he  never  expected  Fang  Yuan  to  have  a  defensive  method  that  could   block  this  Mental  Domain’s  killer  move!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  reverse  flow  protection  seal  already  made  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  feel  a  headache,  he  had  racked  his  brains  to  secretly  deduce  a   luck  path  method  to  counter  it.  But  he  did  not  think  Fang  Yuan  was  still   hiding  another  defensive  method  that  was  even  stronger  than  reverse  flow   protection  seal.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  performance  went  beyond  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s   expectations.</p>
<p>Now,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  wary.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  could  not  break  Fang  Yuan’s   defensive  method,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  the  same!</p>
<p>“I  did  not  think  that  you,  Fang  Yuan,  has  such  deep  attainment  in  wisdom   path  as  well.  In  just  a  short  period  of  time,  you  actually  created,  deduced,   and  modified  so  many  killer  moves.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  entered   the  battlefield  and  praised  Fang  Yuan  sincerely.</p>
<p>This  was  actually  nothing.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  possessed  stealing  heavenly  secret  and  wisdom  Gu,  and  with   sovereign  immortal  body’s  advantage,  it  was  easy  to  create  compound  killer   moves.  Just  one  of  these  advantages  alone  could  make  the  other  venerables   envious.  Now  that  these  advantages  were  stacked  together,  even  Fang  Yuan   felt  it  was  terrifying!</p>
<p>Shocking  Departure  of  Year  Dream  Wave  and  Dang  Hun  Sound  and   heavenly  web  protection  veil  were  only  a  part  of  Fang  Yuan’s  recent  gains.</p>
<p>He  chose  to  use  them  because  he  felt  they  suited  the  situation.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  at  least  ten  killer  moves  of  similar  level.</p>
<p>The  power  of  stealing  heavenly  secret  could  be  seen  from  this;  of  course,   rank  eight  wisdom  Gu  also  provided  a  lot  of  help.</p>
<p>It  was  because  of  these  two  that  Fang  Yuan  caught  up  from  behind  in  terms   of  killer  moves.  He  even  had  a  wide  range  of  options  to  choose  from.</p>
<p>Naturally,  nothing  could  be  perceived  from  Fang  Yuan’s  expression.</p>
<p>Facing  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  he  frowned  and  snorted  coldly:  ”I   must  obtain  these  heaven  path  dream  realms,  Giant  Sun,  you  also  want  to   block  me?  Are  you  still  not  clear  of  who  is  stronger  between  Heavenly   Court  and  me?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  looked  at  Fang  Yuan’s  incisive  gaze,  his   expression  eased  and  turned  somewhat  complex.</p>
<p>In  his  view,  compared  to  Heavenly  Court  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable,  Fang  Yuan  was  still  weaker.</p>
<p>The  reason?</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  have  enough  immortal  essence!</p>
<p>He  had  been  venerable  for  the  shortest  time  and  did  not  even  have  his  own   base.  How  many  natural  refinement  path  dao  marks  did  he  refine  in  this   period  of  time?</p>
<p>It  was  very  obvious.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  looked  powerful,  even  suppressing  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable.  But  in  fact,  he  was  relying  on  the  novelty  of  new  killer  moves   and  their  powerful  strength.</p>
<p>How  much  immortal  essence  could  he  have?</p>
<p>How  could  he  fight  a  battle  of  attrition?</p>
<p>From  what  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  thought,  Fang  Yuan’s  situation   did  not  look  good.</p>
<p>But  even  though  Fang  Yuan  was  weaker,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable   still  needed  to  stop  Fang  Yuan  and  stand  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal   Venerable  for  the  time  being.</p>
<p>The  reason?</p>
<p>Because  Fang  Yuan  wanted  heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>This  could  not  be  allowed!</p>
<p>If  Fang  Yuan  absorbed  all  these  heaven  path  dream  realms,  he  would   definitely  rise  in  power  and  change  the  power  structure  of  the  venerables.</p>
<p>This  was  something  that  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  want  to  see.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  felt  Heavenly  Court  and  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  were  his  greatest  threats,  but  he  also  wanted  to   suppress  the  rise  of  Fang  Yuan  who  was  the  weakest  venerable  but  had  the   most  potential.</p>
<p>Thus,  he  took  part  in  the  battle.  On  the  surface,  he  was  helping  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable;  but  secretly,  he  was  striving  for  Star   Constellation  and  Fang  Yuan  to  expend  their  immortal  essence,  so  that  he   could  maintain  and  enlarge  his  advantage!</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  choice  was  no  doubt  extremely  sensible   from  his  point  of  view.</p>
<p>With  his  help,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  immediately  changed   the  battle  situation  and  began  to  suppress  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>The  environment  in  spectral  heaven  was  not  helpful  to  the  three  venerables,   they  relied  on  their  own  foundation  and  strength.  Under  this  situation,  Fang   Yuan’s  worsening  situation  was  immediately  clear.</p>
<p>After  all,  he  was  fighting  two  opponents  on  his  own.</p>
<p>Naturally,  this  was  under  the  condition  where  Fang  Yuan  preserved  most  of   his  methods  and  did  not  use  his  full  battle  strength.</p>
<p>The  fight  of  the  three  venerables  shook  heaven  and  earth.</p>
<p>Every  Gu  Immortal  in  five  regions  raised  their  heads  and  watched  the  battle   nervously.</p>
<p>“Oh  no,  Lord  Alliance  Leader’s  situation  is  not  good.”</p>
<p>“Good,  good,  good,  this  demon  Fang  Yuan  will  finally  face  retribution!”</p>
<p>“I  did  not  expect  my  Ancestor  Giant  Sun  to  join  hands  with  Heavenly   Court.”</p>
<p>“Heavenly  Court  is  quite  sensible  to  not  look  for  trouble  with  my  Ancestor   Giant  Sun.”</p>
<p>“Being  able  to  make  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  help  her  so  easily   proves  Lady  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  is  indeed  the  number   one  person  in  wisdom  path.”</p>
<p>Rank  eight  Gu  Immortals  understood  the  situation  more  clearly,  they  saw   Fang  Yuan  being  suppressed  and  his  situation  getting  worse.  The  Eastern   Sea  immortals  looked  extremely  solemn  while  Central  Continent  and   Northern  Plains’  Gu  Immortals  were  rejoicing  with  raised  morale.</p>
<p>Thunder  rumbled  and  countless  rays  of  light  exploded  from  the  collision  of   killer  moves.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  situation  did  not  look  good  but  he  was  calm  inwardly.</p>
<p>Although  the  two  venerables  allied,  due  to  their  conflicting  paths,  they   could  only  attack  Fang  Yuan  in  turns.</p>
<p>Moreover,  the  two  venerables  were  wary  of  each  other,  one  would  not  allow   the  other  to  set  a  battlefield.</p>
<p>Without  the  threat  of  a  battlefield  killer  move,  Fang  Yuan  still  had  a  grasp   over  the  choice  of  fighting  or  retreating.</p>
<p>More  importantly,  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  was  already  in  a  heaven  path  dream   realm  and  was  making  good  progress.</p>
<p>Because  of  the  sharing  of  the  clones’  and  main  body’s  attainment  levels,   Fang  Yuan  could  clearly  feel  his  heaven  path  attainment  level  rising  slowly!</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  just  needed  to  maintain  this  situation  and  it  would  do.</p>
<p>What  was  the  use  of  superficial  victory  or  defeat?</p>
<p>Man  strives  for  recognition  while  Buddha  requires  incense;  this  was  a   reasonable  proverb.  But  Fang  Yuan  was  far  beyond  the  age  of  fighting  for   recognition  and  he  was  more  willing  to  strive  for  benefits.</p>
<p>If  the  choice  of  honor  and  benefit  went  against  each  other,  Fang  Yuan   would  unhesitatingly  choose  the  latter.</p>
<p>It  was  this  situation  right  now.</p>
<p>He  could  be  forceful  and  suppress  the  two  venerables.  But  what  was  the  use   when  he  would  not  be  able  to  kill  them?</p>
<p>Instead,  it  would  make  the  two  venerables  wary  and  deepen  their  alliance.   Was  this  not  asking  for  trouble?</p>
<p>As  for  the  support  and  morale  of  the  five  regions’  Gu  Immortals,  Fang  Yuan   did  not  care.</p>
<p>What  was  the  use  of  that?</p>
<p>Even  if  Fang  Yuan  was  defeated  miserably  today,  the  five  regions’  Gu   Immortals  still  could  not  defeat  him.  They  still  had  to  fear  and  revere  Fang   Yuan.</p>
<p>As  long  as  Fang  Yuan  was  not  dead,  could  Fang  clan,  the  two  heavens’   grotto-heavens’  variant  humans,  or  even  the  Eastern  Sea  super  forces  side   with  someone  else?</p>
<p>They  still  had  to  follow  Fang  Yuan!</p>
<p>It  was  just  that  they  would  be  more  worried  about  their  future.</p>
<p>But  what  did  the  worries  of  these  minor  characters  have  to  do  with  Fang   Yuan?</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  need  to  bother  with  such  things.</p>
<p>There  were  no  two  ways  about  it,  these  minor  characters  were  only   resources  and  tools  in  Fang  Yuan’s  eyes.  The  Gu  cultivation  world  was   ruled  by  the  strong,  the  actual  trend  of  the  world  still  depended  on  the  fight   between  venerables.</p>
<p>Even  if  Fang  Yuan  was  defeated,  as  long  as  Meng  Qiu  Zhen  made  huge   gains,  he  would  be  the  biggest  winner.  The  loss  could  be  considered  a   victory.</p>
<p>Even  if  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  and  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  beat  Fang  Yuan  badly,  as  long  as  Fang  Yuan  lived  and  absorbed   all  the  heaven  path  dream  realms,  their  victory  would  be  the  same  as  defeat.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  this,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  aware  of   it  as  well.</p>
<p>The  alliance  of  the  two  venerables  could  not  make  Fang  Yuan  retreat,  he   was  still  absorbing  the  true  meaning  in  the  heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  truly  anxious.</p>
<p>She  transmitted  her  voice  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable:  ”Giant  Sun,  if   this  continues,  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  will  succeed.  What  are   you  still  holding  back  for?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  snorted  coldly:  ”Star  Constellation,  are  you   telling  me  that  you  are  not  holding  back?”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  a  solemn  expression:  ”I  am   going  to  prepare  a  killer  move  to  search  for  Fang  Yuan’s  dream  path  clone   and  try  to  eradicate  it!”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  took  a  deep  look  at  her  before  nodding:   ”Then  I  will  target  Fang  Yuan’s  reverse  flow  protection  seal  and  pressure   him  in  order  to  create  a  chance  for  you.”</p>
