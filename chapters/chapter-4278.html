        <p>: Heavenly Melody</p>
<p>Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios</p>
<p>Among the Gu Immortals who came to purchase Fang clan slaves, there might be Fang clan Gu Immortals, but treasure yellow heaven would not decipher them.</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu did not care.</p>
<p>He quoted his price expressionlessly, it was a normal price that was neither too low nor high.</p>
<p>Immediately, several transactions were completed.</p>
<p>"With this batch of Fang clan members, I have made up for the final gap, I can try to refine wealth Gu now." Shi Kang was very happy.</p>
<p>"Please don't let me get sold to Fang clan Gu Immortals!" Wang Xiao Er prayed in his heart.</p>
<p>"I'll take this batch, they seem to be of decent quality." The Gu Immortal spoke to Xiao Ye Hu and chose a batch.</p>
<p>Even among human slaves, quality differed.</p>
<p>Among which, rank five Gu Masters were the most popular, following that were the young and talented Gu Masters.</p>
<p>At once, crying sounds could be heard.</p>
<p>The Fang clan members were sold off, their families were broken up for good, they bid farewell to each other here for the last time, it was a sad sight to see.</p>
<p>Here, the Fang clan members' lives would be greatly changed, the future was bound to be very different from now.</p>
<p>The pitiful Fang clan members would be sold to Shi Kang as Gu materials and used till they died.</p>
<p>Some of the luckier ones would be specially chosen as Gu Immortal seeds to join certain sects or clans. If they succeed in becoming Gu Immortals in the future, it would be a huge profit for the buyer.</p>
<p>Of course, there were few who were regarded as Gu Immortal seeds.</p>
<p>"Fang clan lost but they are not out yet. It seems that this contest will still go on." In the two heavens, Fairy Zi Wei retracted her divine sense from treasure yellow heaven.</p>
<p>She had been paying close attention to the trend of the world recently.</p>
<p>Currently, she had already been in the two heavens with Ying Wu Xie for a few days.</p>
<p>During this period of time, they had a tough journey filled with difficulties and danger.</p>
<p>The immemorial two heavens were dangerous to begin with, ordinary rank eight Gu Immortals had to be very careful when they explored.</p>
<p>Now that the two heavens had fused, the environment was chaotic and messy, it was filled with changes. The five regions had already been implicated, while the fused two heavens itself was even more intense.</p>
<p>From time to time, roaming immemorial desolate beasts would appear, there could even be huge armies made of desolate beasts, ancient desolate beasts, and even immemorial desolate beasts.</p>
<p>It was still relatively safer to meet wild beasts, the scariest thing was getting into a place with dense dao marks, because the two heavens had shattered and fused together, many dangerous and forbidden places were shifting around now.</p>
<p>If one got trapped, they would be like a mortal stepping into a quicksand in the desert, they could only wait for death in despair.</p>
<p>Even an expert like Fairy Zi Wei would encounter danger.</p>
<p>"Ying Wu Xie, just how far away are we?" Fairy Zi Wei asked.</p>
<p>Currently, they were hiding within a soul beast army.</p>
<p>This soul beast army had many ancient soul beasts, Ying Wu Xie took control of it.</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie replied: "From what I sense, we still need three days to reach the main body. During this period, if he moves, the timing could be extended or shortened."</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie used a soul path killer move and managed to sense the location of his main body.</p>
<p>But Spectral Soul Demon Venerable's speed was far beyond them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable had lost his senses, he did not use defensive methods against investigations, he was also roaming around causing destruction, he did not avoid them.</p>
<p>Thus, during this time, Ying Wu Xie and Fairy Zi Wei managed to get closer to Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.</p>
<p>Howl!</p>
<p>The soul beast that was moving ahead suddenly stopped, it cried out in pain like it had slammed into an invisible wall.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Fairy Zi Wei instantly became alert.</p>
<p>"Be careful, all of you, stop!" Ying Wu Xie also controlled his soul beast army and stopped, floating in the air.</p>
<p>In the past few days, they had used the soul beasts to probe many dangerous areas.</p>
<p>The cost was thirty percent of the soul beasts they controlled.</p>
<p>"This is… heavenly chasm?" Fairy Zi Wei checked and gasped in surprise.</p>
<p>Heavenly chasm was a rank nine heaven path immortal material, it had an irregular form but was incredibly big. It was formless and ethereal, although it seemed like empty air, it could not be passed through.</p>
<p>"We are so unlucky, to think that we would be obstructed by this!" Ying Wu Xie was disappointed.</p>
<p>The heavenly chasm was not dangerous but it was a huge problem for them.</p>
<p>Because they needed to get past the heavenly chasm, but they could not find out what its exact shape or distribution was.</p>
<p>Both Fairy Zi Wei's and Ying Wu Xie's investigative methods had a smaller range than the size of the entire heavenly chasm.</p>
<p>In other words, they could only test their luck by choosing one direction and trying to get around it from there.</p>
<p>It was inestimable how much time they would need to use up now.</p>
<p>But there was no helping it, Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie could only make a detour.</p>
<p>After moving for a long distance, the heavenly chasm remained in front of them, it was like a huge wall that blocked their every path.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sound was transmitted into Ying Wu Xie and Fairy Zi Wei's ears.</p>
<p>Initially, they did not mind it, they thought that it was a normal wind sound.</p>
<p>But soon, it got louder and more delightful.</p>
<p>When the two immortals were attracted by the sound, their actions unconsciously slowed down.</p>
<p>After more than ten breaths of time, the entire soul beast army had stopped in the air, they were completely entranced by the beautiful sound.</p>
<p>This sound did not contain any instrumental component, it purely composed of wind, rain, thunder, bird chirping sounds and so on. However, the outcome was a beautiful melody that made Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie addicted to it.</p>
<p>"Oh no, this is the heavenly melody!" Fairy Zi Wei was internally shaken, she wanted to warn Ying Wu Xie but she only gasped out loud, her body completely relaxed as she fell into deep entrancement.</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie had lower cultivation level than her, he was much more immersed in it, he was already showing an expression of indulgence, he could not save himself.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei's heart was sinking.</p>
<p>She knew that this was a truly desperate situation.</p>
<p>If this went on, she and Ying Wu Xie, along with the soul beasts, would be completely immersed in the heavenly melody, they would eventually lose their senses and become floating corpses.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei wanted to save herself but after several attempts, she could not even activate any Gu worm, not to mention killer moves.</p>
<p>If she had reacted in time and did her best to stop it, there might be a chance of survival.</p>
<p>But she had been listening to the heavenly melody for too long, she was like a human struggling after falling into the water, her strength was depleting as she drank more and more water.</p>
<p>"Am I… going to die here?" Fairy Zi Wei felt her eyelids getting heavier, her vision was turning blur, she could not help but feel like shutting her</p>
<p>eyes and enjoying the beautiful melody with her full attention.</p>
<p>This might be the most enjoyable way to die.</p>
<p>As Fairy Zi Wei approached death, her mind was filled with indulgent and wonderful emotions.</p>
<p>If she died, she would not feel any sadness, despair, pain, or other negative emotions.</p>
<p>But right when Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie were about to die, the heavenly melody started weakening.</p>
<p>A Gu Immortal was flying closer to them from afar.</p>
<p>He wore a red and white robe, standing straight like a spear or sword. His eyebrows were sharp like swords, a mysterious and profound light was hidden in his eyes.</p>
<p>He revealed a faint smile from the corner of his lips, he gave off the aura of gentleness and confidence.</p>
<p>It was the current rank eight sound path great expert — Feng Jiu Ge!</p>
<p>"What a beautiful heavenly melody." Feng Jiu Ge laughed brightly as he looked at the soul beast army and the two incapacitated immortals, Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie.</p>
<p>The heavenly melody that almost killed the two Shadow Sect members did not manage to affect Feng Jiu Ge, in fact, he used a mysterious method to contain and collect it.</p>
<p>"Feng Jiu Ge?!" As Fairy Zi Wei slowly recovered, she looked at the Gu Immortal in front of her with shock.</p>
<p>Ever since the fate war, Feng Jiu Ge went missing without a trace. Had he been in the two heavens all along?</p>
<p>Since he was able to take the rank nine immortal material heavenly melody, did this mean that his strength had grown again? Did he retain his pseudo venerable battle strength?</p>
<p>It was a mystery.</p>
<p>As Feng Jiu Ge collected and stored the heavenly melody, he activated a killer move.</p>
<p>Two lumps of profound light shot into Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie, wrapping around them and slowly entering their bodies.</p>
<p>Because of the heavenly melody, Fairy Zi Wei still could not move, Feng Jiu Ge was free to do this without resistance.</p>
<p>"What… what killer move is this? What are you trying to do?" Fairy Zi Wei slowly regained her ability to speak.</p>
<p>Feng Jiu Ge replied: "Don't worry, I'm not seeking to harm you. After the fate war, haven't our circumstances become quite similar now?"</p>
<p>Feng Jiu Ge said this as he turned to leave.</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei could not catch up, she watched as he flew away casually.</p>
<p>"What, what happened?" Ying Wu Xie recovered and watched Feng Jiu Ge's figure fly far away in the sky.</p>
<p>"We were hit by the heavenly melody and fell into grave danger. But Feng Jiu Ge suddenly appeared and collected the heavenly melody, he also used a mysterious method on us." Fairy Zi Wei explained the situation quickly.</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie stared with wide eyes: "What… Feng Jiu Ge didn't kill us?"</p>
<p>"He is also a demonic path member, he has betrayed Heavenly Court, what is the point of killing us?" Fairy Zi Wei sighed: "If he wanted us to die, he could have waited by the side, he would gain our corpses, immortal apertures, and Immortal Gu. His motive was to get the heavenly melody, other than that, he also wanted to use that move on us."</p>
<p>The two used their methods and inspected their bodies, but could not find anything strange or peculiar.</p>
<p>It was as if Feng Jiu Ge's killer move was just an illusion that had not actually been used.</p>
<p>"Regardless of whether he has pseudo venerable battle strength, his methods are becoming more profound!" Fairy Zi Wei sighed.</p>
<p>"What killer move is this?" Ying Wu Xie frowned: "Is he trying to use us as bait to harm the main body?"</p>
<p>Fairy Zi Wei shook her head: "We have too few clues, but according to my intuition, Feng Jiu Ge does not seem interested in Master Spectral Soul. Also, even if your guess is correct, are we going to stop here?"</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie considered it and gritted his teeth while nodding: "Of course we have to continue moving. Even if Feng Jiu Ge wants to harm the main body, he is only rank eight, how can he harm my main body?"</p>
<p>The two immortals set off again.</p>
<p>Because of the heavenly melody, half of the beast group was wiped out.</p>
<p>Since they were near the heavenly chasm, the army could not be replenished.</p>
<p>This time, to guard against the heavenly melody, the soul beasts were widely spread out, they were far from each other.</p>
<p>"The main body, I can sense the main body!" Not long after, Ying Wu Xie suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>Following his sensation, the two immortals changed directions and saw Spectral Soul Demon Venerable after a few minutes.</p>
<p>"So the main body was on the other side of the heavenly chasm, but because of this rank nine immortal material's interference, I thought that he was far away!" Ying Wu Xie suddenly realized.</p>
<p>He shouted: "I am here!"</p>
<p>Spectral Soul Demon Venerable saw Ying Wu Xie and immediately roared.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>With a chain of sounds, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable landed several hundred fists on the heavenly chasm.</p>
<p>The heavenly chasm shook intensely, it was on the brink of breaking.</p>
<p>Ying Wu Xie and Fairy Zi Wei turned pale, why did Spectral Soul Demon Venerable turn so ferocious after seeing Ying Wu Xie? It was as if they were mortal enemies.</p>
