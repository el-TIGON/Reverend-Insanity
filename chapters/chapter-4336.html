        <p>:  Yin-Yang  Path,  Multiple</p>
<p>Pregnancy  Gu</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  saw  Yao  Huang’s  expression  of  confusion  and  laughed,  he   explained  happily:  ”When  a  Gu  Master  undergoes  immortal  ascension,  they   will  have  a  fortuitous  encounter  known  as  natural  inspiration.”</p>
<p>“What  is  the  cause  of  it?”</p>
<p>“Heaven  and  earth  qi  contain  heaven’s  will  while  human  qi  contains  human   will,  at  this  crucial  moment,  the  three  qi  fuse  together,  meaning  heaven’s   will  and  human  will  congregate,  allowing  the  person  to  ask  heaven  and   earth  for  answers  regarding  the  profundities  and  truths  of  the  world.”</p>
<p>“This  is  because  heaven’s  will  acknowledged  the  human  will.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“From  what  I  see,  once  an  aperture  undergoes  qualitative  change,  it  will   become  an  immortal  aperture.  This  is  an  achievement  that  grants  benefit  to   the  world.  The  Heavenly  Dao  wants  to  see  this  happen,  thus,  it  rewards  the   human  will.”</p>
<p>“The  specialty  of  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  lies  here,  its  body  is  made  of  the   Qi  of  Unified  Essence,  which  is  the  fusion  of  three  qi,  thus,  it  is  able  to   receive  the  acknowledgment  and  reward  of  heaven’s  will  at  all  times.”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  stared  with  wide  eyes:  ”That  means  it  is  able  to  undergo  natural   inspiration  at  all  times?!”</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  shook  his  head:  ”Strictly  speaking,  yes!  But  the  truth  is  different.   We  all  know  that  the  three  qi  create  the  Unified  Essence,  it  needs  to  be   balanced  carefully.  If  the  lump  of  three  qi  loses  balance,  the  Gu  cultivator   will  die.  This  is  not  true  for  Yi  Qi  Zi,  failure  to  balance  the  three  qi  will  not   cause  it  to  be  in  fatal  danger,  instead,  it  will  lose  its  rationality.”</p>
<p>“Continuously  controlling  and  balancing  the  three  qi  is  too  difficult.”</p>
<p>“We  have  all  undergone  immortal  ascension,  it  is  already  too  tough  for  us  to   sustain  the  state  of  balancing  the  three  qi  for  half  a  day.  But  Unified   Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  has  to  undergo  it  at  all  times.”</p>
<p>“Thus,  after  it  expends  all  its  effort  or  gets  sick  of  balancing  the  three  qi,  its   body  will  lose  control  of  the  three  qi.  This  causes  heaven’s  will  and  the   human  will  to  intertwine  and  result  in  chaos,  causing  it  to  lose  its   rationality.”</p>
<p>“In  this  condition,  it  cannot  even  think  normally,  how  can  it  make  use  of  the   natural  inspiration?”</p>
<p>“Regardless,  as  long  as  the  Qi  of  Unified  Essence  exists,  heaven’s  will  still   favors  the  human  will,  it  will  be  willing  to  help.”</p>
<p>“If  this  is  an  ordinary  Gu  Master  who  has  not  created  the  immortal  aperture   yet,  they  will  only  be  able  to  interact  with  heaven’s  will  and  undergo  natural   inspiration.  But  Yi  Qi  Zi  is  different,  it  has  an  immortal  aperture  already.   Thus,  when  it  is  sane  and  clearheaded,  its  immortal  aperture  will  produce   immortal  essence.  When  it  is  irrational  and  insane,  its  immortal  aperture   will  produce  immortal  essence  stones  that  contain  heaven’s  will.”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  finally  understood  everything.</p>
<p>Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  was  too  special,  because  of  its  unique  physique,   Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  gained  immortal  essence  stones.  But   he  only  distributed  rank  six  immortal  essence  stones.</p>
<p>After  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  died,  Star  Constellation  assimilated  with  the   Dao,  although  she  could  control  heaven’s  will  to  some  extent,  there  was  a   limit  to  it.  Thus,  from  then  on,  Heavenly  Court  could  only  produce  rank  six   immortal  essence  stones.</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  continued:  ”  Back  then,  I  accidentally  found  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi   Zi  in  the  fierce  area,  it  was  in  a  state  of  insanity,  buried  deep  underground   and  unable  to  move.  I  spoke  with  it  but  it  could  not  respond  clearly,  its   answer  was  jumbled  but  it  cursed  Heavenly  Court’s  two  venerables  with   deep  hatred.  After  some  time,  I  pieced  together  the  story  and  deduced  many   truths  behind  the  situation.”</p>
<p>“I  mobilized  the  entire  Fei  tribe  and  wanted  to  obtain  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi   Zi.  I  expended  immortal  materials  and  modified  killer  moves  to  try  and   manipulate  it.  After  completing  my  preparations,  I  went  into  the  fierce  area   and  execute  my  plan.  But  to  think  that  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  actually   had  its  sanity,  at  that  time,  I  could  not  back  out  anymore,  I  had  to  continue   my  plan  forcefully.  Fei  tribe  was  wiped  out  while  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi   was  also  sealed  by  our  Fei  tribe’s  method!”</p>
<p>“Without  any  accidents,  it  should  still  be  trapped  at  the  original  spot,   Ancestor,  you  only  need  to  go  retrieve  it.”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  nodded,  he  brought  Fei  Wu  to  the  Jade  Ring   fierce  area.</p>
<p>Northern  Plains  had  ten  great  fierce  areas,  within  them  were  countless   desolate  beast  groups,  immemorial  desolate  beast  and  plants  were  also  not   rare.</p>
<p>Super  forces  had  the  ability  to  develop  in  them,  but  if  a  mistake  happened,   they  would  trigger  a  huge  beast  tide.  Fei  tribe’s  failure  was  one  of  the   examples.</p>
<p>Jade  Ring  fierce  area  had  more  than  ten  different  rings  of  huge  ancient   trees.</p>
<p>As  one  entered  deeper  into  each  ring,  they  would  face  more  danger  and   threat.</p>
<p>Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  was  hidden  in  the  sixth  ring.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  personally  took  action,  he  quickly  arrived  at   it.  Fei  Wu  had  just  revived  and  had  no  Gu  worms  but  he  was  only  giving   directions.</p>
<p>Towards  his  ancestor,  he  did  not  hide  anything  but  only  said  the  truth.</p>
<p>After  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  made  his  deductions,  he  used  a  newly   modified  luck  path  killer  move,  it  triggered  the  arrangements  of  Fei  tribe.</p>
<p>After  doing  that,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  extracted  a  huge  black   pearl  from  deep  underground.</p>
<p>The  black  pearl  was  large  as  an  elephant,  it  had  a  smooth  surface  and  a   deeply  hidden  aura.</p>
<p>“This  is  the  result  that  our  Fei  tribe  created,  even  a  legendary  immemorial   beast  was  sealed  by  us!”  Fei  Wu  looked  at  Yi  Qi  Zi  as  he  sighed  with  deep   emotions.</p>
<p>He  had  grand  ambitions  that  ended  in  failure  and  the  entire  Fei  tribe  was   wiped  out.  But  thankfully,  he  was  able  to  revive  and  use  the  arrangements   they  made  to  help  their  ancestor,  this  was  all  worth  it!</p>
<p>After  inspecting  for  some  time,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  saw  through   the  information  of  Yi  Qi  Zi  using  the  intel  from  Fei  Wu.</p>
<p>Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  was  a  lump  of  the  Qi  of  Unified  Essence.  When  it   was  sane,  it  would  be  in  human  form,  the  appearance  would  be  hard  to   differentiate  from  actual  people.</p>
<p>When  it  stops  balancing  the  three  qi  and  they  go  into  chaos,  it  would  turn   into  a  lump  of  the  Qi  of  Unified  Essence.</p>
<p>If  there  was  more  heaven  qi,  it  would  float  higher,  if  there  was  more  earth   qi,  it  would  sink  into  the  ground.</p>
<p>When  Fei  tribe  fought  against  it,  it  had  not  regained  its  sanity  fully,  thus,  it   could  not  use  its  full  strength.</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  and  the  rest  made  ample  preparations,  they  deduced  a  killer  move   that  countered  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi,  eventually  sealing  it  here.</p>
<p>Although  Fei  Wu  was  only  rank  seven,  Fei  tribe  had  many  rank  eights  in   the  past,  they  also  had  Immortal  Gu  Houses  that  were  the  foundation  of  a   super  force.  Most  importantly,  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi  was  not  sane  so  its   strength  could  not  be  used  properly.</p>
<p>Without  rationality,  even  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  could  not  take   down  Fairy  Zi  Wei  and  Ying  Wu  Xie.</p>
<p>A  long  time  had  passed,  by  now,  Fei  tribe’s  killer  move  was  already  greatly   weakened,  the  sealing  effect  had  reached  its  limit.</p>
<p>But  even  if  Yi  Qi  Zi  regained  freely,  in  its  current  condition,  it  would   remain  on  the  spot  without  regaining  its  senses.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  looked  through  the  Qi  of  Unified  Essence   and  inspected  that  deep  within  its  immortal  aperture,  there  were  many  rank   eight  immortal  essence  stones.</p>
<p>The  production  of  immortal  essence  was  as  natural  as  breathing  to  the   immortal  aperture  origin  core,  with  heaven’s  will  suppressing  the  human   will  the  entire  time,  legendary  immemorial  beast  Yi  Qi  Zi’s  immortal   aperture  had  a  large  number  of  rank  eight  immortal  essence  stones!</p>
<p>Rank  six  immortal  essence  stones  had  little  significance  to  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable,  but  rank  eight  immortal  essence  stones  were  different.</p>
<p>While  happy,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  also  found  a  problem.</p>
<p>There  was  a  lot  of  heaven’s  will  inside  these  rank  eight  immortal  essence   stones,  if  he  wanted  to  absorb  them,  he  would  need  to  get  rid  of  the   heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>It  was  troublesome.</p>
<p>If  he  handled  it  poorly,  it  would  affect  the  conversion  rate  of  the  immortal   essence  stones.</p>
<p>For  example,  one  rank  eight  immortal  essence  stone  might  only  be  able  to   produce  half  a  bead  of  rank  eight  immortal  essence  after  getting  rid  of  the   heaven’s  will.</p>
<p>Rank  six  immortal  essence  stones  had  no  such  problem  because  the   heaven’s  will  inside  was  too  little.</p>
<p>After  considering  it  for  a  while,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  thought:   ”Back  then,  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  made  use  of  Yi  Qi  Zi,  he   also  had  rank  eight  immortal  essence  stones  but  only  distributed  the  rank   six  version,  he  was  not  likely  trying  not  to  alert  the  variant  human  Gu   Immortals.  By  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  era,  Yi  Qi  Zi   suicided  and  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  altered  heaven’s  will,   by  fusing  it  with  Heavenly  Court’s  origin  core,  they  could  only  produce   rank  six  immortal  essence  stones.”</p>
<p>“However,  where  did  the  storage  of  rank  eight  immortal  essence  stones  go?   Are  they  use  dup  or  hidden  somewhere?”</p>
<p>“If  they  are  hidden,  why  did  I  not  find  them  when  I  attacked  Heavenly   Court?  Did  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  obtain  them  after  ransacking   Heavenly  Court’s  treasury?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  shook  his  head.</p>
<p>Afterwards,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  was  captured  by  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  made  turned  into  her  puppet.</p>
<p>If  he  had  obtained  those  valuable  rank  eight  immortal  essence  stones,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  would  have  retrieved  them.</p>
<p>But  the  situation  was  clear,  she  had  always  been  lacking  immortal  essence   the  entire  time!</p>
<p>“No,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  cultivates  wisdom  path,  what  if   she  is  hiding  it  the  entire  time?”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  frowned,  his   expression  turned  slightly  solemn.</p>
<p>“If  she  has  an  abundant  supply  of  immortal  essence,  why  does  she  still  lack   it?  In  what  area  did  she  use  the  essence?”</p>
<p>Ever  since  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  refined  Heavenly  Court’s   wisdom  path  dao  marks,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  not  inspected   her  situation  anymore.</p>
<p>As  for  Fang  Yuan,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  could  inspect  him  easily   each  time.</p>
<p>“If  that  is  the  situation,  then  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable…  How   much  are  you  hiding?  How  deep  are  your  secrets?”  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  looked  in  the  direction  of  Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>“Any  venerable  has  talent  that  is  unimaginable  to  the  average  genius.”  Fang   Yuan  had  already  comprehended  the  information  that  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  handed  to  him  in  their  transaction.</p>
<p>He  obtained  what  he  wanted.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  already  refined  rank  five  blood  skull  Gu.</p>
<p>Earlier,  he  was  only  using  rank  four  blood  skull  Gu,  but  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  had  a  newly  developed  rank  five  version.</p>
<p>Although  it  was  a  mortal  Gu  recipe,  it  had  developed  beyond  the  original   limit  of  the  world,  this  showed  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  immense</p>
<p>talent.</p>
<p>Rank  five  blood  skull  Gu  only  needed  to  extract  a  certain  amount  of   bloodline  from  the  target’s  kin,  there  was  no  need  to  slaughter  the  entire   clan.</p>
<p>There  was  also  a  method  to  produce  twins.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  no  choice  but  to  hand  over  the  research   results  of  yin-yang  path  that  he  was  secretly  looking  into.</p>
<p>Back  then,  in  Eighty-Eight  True  Yang  Building,  there  was  the  inheritance  of   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  regarding  yin-yang  path.  The  content  was  a   method,  to  use  it,  a  male  and  female  Gu  Immortal  had  to  cooperate,  using   copulation  to  extend  the  lifespan  of  one  of  them.</p>
<p>But  there  was  a  flaw  in  this.</p>
<p>If  one  gains  lifespan,  the  other  must  lose  lifespan.</p>
<p>In  other  words,  it  was  to  transfer  the  lifespan  of  one  person  to  the  other.</p>
<p>Right  now,  the  yin-yang  path  research  result  that  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  handed  to  Fang  Yuan  was  much  more  complete  and   comprehensive  than  the  one  hidden  in  Eighty-Eight  True  Yang  Building.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  had  grand  ambitions  in  creating  this  path,  he   wanted  to  use  yin-yang  to  describe  all  beings  in  the  world.</p>
<p>This  was  the  same  as  Feng  Jiu  Ge’s  desire  to  use  sound  path  to  express  all   life  in  this  world.</p>
<p>But  as  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  strength  and  knowledge  increased,   he  recognized  that  his  former  ideology  of  yin-yang  was  very  shallow,  he   eventually  gave  up  on  creating  it.</p>
<p>Although  there  were  some  research  results  in  yin-yang  path,  it  could  not   achieve  a  qualitative  change  to  become  a  brand  new  path.  At  most,  it  could</p>
<p>be  used  with  other  paths  to  occasionally  create  some  unorthodox  small   gains.</p>
<p>Yin-yang  life  extension  method  was  one  of  such  results.</p>
<p>Another  of  such  small  gains  were  abortion  Gu,  safe  pregnancy  Gu,  multiple   pregnancy  Gu,  become  pregnant  Gu,  reincarnation  Gu,  dead  fetus  Gu,  and   others.</p>
<p>Multiple  pregnancy  Gu  was  what  Fang  Yuan  wanted.</p>
<p>Rank  one  could  be  used  to  produce  one  child,  rank  two  produced  twins.   Rank  three  produced  triplets,  rank  four  produced  quadruplets,  and  rank  five   produced  quintuplets.</p>
