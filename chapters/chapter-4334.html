        <p>:  Unified  Essence,  Yi  Qi  Zi</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  words  made  Fei  Wu  shook  intensely  as  he   showed  an  expression  of  gratitude:  ”Ancestor  is  wise!  The  so-called  Fei   tribe’s  internal  conflict  was  just  our  disguise  to  the  outside  world.  The  truth   is,  if  not  for  that  beast  tide,  how  could  our  united  Fei  tribe  be  wiped  out?”</p>
<p>“Back  then,  I  expended  countless  immortal  material  resources  but  I  did  not   use  up  Fei  tribe’s  foundation.  Afterwards,  when  we  developed  in  the  fierce   area,  I  even  took  away  Yi  Qi  Zi  which  was  deep  within  it!”</p>
<p>“However,  legendary  immemorial  beast  Yi  Qi  Zi  had  already  recovered  to  a   great  extent,  it  was  not  unconscious.  We  fell  for  its  ploy  and  ended  up  being   exterminated  by  the  beast  tide.”</p>
<p>“But  in  the  end,  our  Fei  tribe  did  our  best  to  retaliate,  Yi  Qi  Zi  did  not   succeed  after  all.  Its  will  was  completely  eradicated  by  us!”</p>
<p>“It  is  a  huge  pity!”</p>
<p>“If  Yi  Qi  Zi  did  not  ruin  our  plan,  my  Fei  tribe  would  have  dominated   Northern  Plains  with  an  unceasing  quantity  of  immortal  essence  stones.  We   will  become  the  number  one  Huang  Jin  tribe  and  to  a  certain  extent,  rival   Heavenly  Court!!”</p>
<p>After  hearing  this,  Yao  Huang  stared  with  wide  eyes  as  he  asked   consecutive  questions.</p>
<p>“Yi  Qi  Zi?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t  that  a  legendary  immemorial  desolate  beast  which  appeared  in  the   earliest  history  of  humanity?  Legend  says  that  it  was  killed  by  Primordial   Origin  Immortal  Venerable,  how  can  it  still  be  alive?”</p>
<p>“An  unceasing  source  of  immortal  essence  stones?  Senior,  did  you  unravel   the  mystery  behind  Heavenly  Court’s  production  of  immortal  essence   stones?”</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  silent  as  he  listened.  If  reviving  Fei  Wu   would  get  him  immortal  essence  stones,  it  was  not  significant  enough.   However,  his  luck  inspection  showed  that  Fei  Wu  was  very  useful  to  him.</p>
<p>Within  Blood  Sea,  Yao  Huang  was  getting  more  excited,  he  clasped  his  fist   with  his  palm  and  said:  ”Good,  Senior  Fei  Wu  has  woken  up  right  on  time.   As  long  as  we  have  this  way  to  produce  immortal  essence  stones,  we  can   raise  our  reputation  and  catch  up  to  Heavenly  Court.  This  is  definitely  a   great  chance  now  that  Heavenly  Court  has  stopped  distributing  immortal   essence  stones.  Once  we  take  over,  it  will  cause  everyone  to  have  a  deep   impression  of  Longevity  Heaven  beyond  Heavenly  Court!”</p>
<p>The  more  Yao  Huang  spoke,  the  happier  he  got.</p>
<p>“Heavenly  Court  stopped  distributing  immortal  essence  stones?  That’s   because  they  can’t  produce  it  anymore.”  Fei  Wu  was  still  kneeling  on  the   ground,  but  he  raised  his  upper  body  and  said  with  a  snicker,  he  was  certain   about  the  reason.</p>
<p>“Oh?  Get  up  and  talk,  tell  me  about  it  clearly.”  Giant  Sun  Immortal   Venerable  descended  upon  Blood  Sea,  he  arrived  before  Fei  Wu.</p>
<p>“Yes.”  Fei  Wu  bowed  deeply  again  before  getting  up:  ”I  will  explain  from   the  start.”</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  explained  slowly:  ”Everyone  knows  that  in  this  world,  primeval   energy  is  infinite,  spirit  springs  produce  primeval  stones,  but  nobody  has   never  found  an  immortal  spring  that  can  produce  immortal  essence  stones.”</p>
<p>“Wild  Gu,  be  it  mortal  or  immortal,  can  absorb  primeval  energy  to  activate   their  abilities.  But  once  they  are  refined,  the  Gu  worm  will  be  someone’s   possession,  they  will  lose  the  ability  to  use  primeval  energy.  They  will  only   be  able  to  use  primeval  essence  or  immortal  essence.”</p>
<p>“This  primeval  essence  and  immortal  essence  includes  both  the  owner  and   others.  If  a  Gu  worm  is  lent  out,  the  Gu  worm  can  still  use  others’  primeval   essence  or  immortal  essence.  For  example,  an  Immortal  Gu  House  can  use   the  stored  immortal  essence  of  Gu  Immortals  inside.”</p>
<p>“What  is  the  root  cause  of  all  these?”</p>
<p>“According  to  my  research,  the  reason  is  that  be  it  primeval  essence  or   immortal  essence,  both  contain  our  human  will.  Wild  Gu  contain  heaven’s   will,  they  are  a  product  of  heaven  and  earth,  thus,  we  say  that  Gu  is  the   essence  of  heaven  and  earth.  Once  we  refine  Gu  worms,  the  heaven’s  will   inside  will  be  purged,  replaced  by  our  human  will.”</p>
<p>“As  a  result,  the  Gu  worm  becomes  privately  owned  and  the  human  will   does  not  get  acknowledged  by  the  heaven’s  will  of  the  outside  world.  Thus,   the  Gu  can  no  longer  absorb  external  primeval  energy.”</p>
<p>“If  lent  to  others,  the  human  will  inside  the  Gu  worm  will  acknowledge   others  so  they  can  use  their  own  primeval  essence  or  immortal  essence  to   activate  it.”</p>
<p>“Different  immortal  essence  contain  different  human,  thus,  they  can  cancel   each  other  out.  This  is  why  many  rank  six  Gu  Immortals  fail  to  succeed   when  they  invade  blessed  lands  that  are  already  owned.”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  was  confused:  ”What  does  this  have  to  do  with  immortal   essence  stone  production?”</p>
<p>“Don’t  be  anxious,  listen  to  what  I  am  saying,  it  will  make  sense  soon.”  Fei   Wu  waved  his  hand  and  smiled.</p>
<p>“Our  aperture  produces  primeval  essence  while  our  immortal  aperture   produces  immortal  essence,  they  all  contain  our  human  will.  Then,  do   primeval  stones  and  immortal  essence  stones  not  have  a  will  in  them?”</p>
<p>“They  do!”</p>
<p>The  primeval  stones  that  spirit  springs  produce  are  essentially  reinforced   primeval  essence  that  contains  heaven’s  will.  It  is  just  that  the  primeval   stones  contain  too  little  heaven’s  will,  it  is  common  to  ignore  it.  However,   the  heaven’s  will  often  sneaks  into  our  minds  while  we  absorb  primeval   stones  to  influence  our  thoughts.  This  is  one  way  that  heaven’s  will  use  to   control  us!”</p>
<p>“It  is  a  pity  that  most  Gu  cultivators  in  the  world  are  attracted  to  the  effect   of  restoring  primeval  essence  through  primeval  stones,  they  do  not  notice   this  issue.”</p>
<p>“Even  if  they  do,  they  don’t  care  about  it.  Heaven’s  will  is  just  like  air,  it  is   everywhere,  so  it  is  quite  normal  to  have  some  in  primeval  stones.”</p>
<p>“The  immortal  essence  stones  that  Heavenly  Court  gives  out  are  the  same   as  primeval  stones  in  that  they  also  contain  heaven’s  will.”</p>
<p>“Why  does  Heavenly  Court  give  out  rank  six  immortal  essence  stones?”</p>
<p>“It  is  actually  a  huge  scheme  by  Heavenly  Court!”</p>
<p>“During  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  era,  Heavenly  Court   purposely  gave  out  immortal  essence  stones.  These  immortal  essence  stones   reached  the  hands  of  the  variant  human  Gu  Immortals  and  were  used  by   them.  This  allowed  heaven’s  will  to  infiltrate  them.”</p>
<p>“Back  then,  heaven’s  will  sided  with  humanity  which  would  rise  to  take  the   position  of  the  variant  humans.”</p>
<p>“By  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  era,  she  became  one  with  the   Dao  and  gained  the  ability  to  distort  heaven’s  will,  greatly  influencing  it.   The  distribution  of  immortal  essence  stones  became  even  more  widespread.   When  Gu  Immortals  use  these  immortal  essence  stones,  they  will  be   infiltrated  by  heaven’s  will,  allowing  Heavenly  Court  to  influence  and   control  them!”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  heard  his  words  as  his  mouth  opened  slightly:  ”So  that’s  it?  Can   we  copy  Heavenly  Court  to  distribute  immortal  essence  stones  and  achieve   the  same  effect  for  our  Longevity  Heaven?”</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  shook  his  head:  ”Unless  we  can  assimilate  with  the  Dao  like  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  to  alter  heaven’s  will.”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  was  anxious  now:  ”Even  if  we  can’t  achieve  the  same  effect,  as   long  as  we  have  an  unceasing  supply  of  immortal  essence  stones,  we  can   still  use  it  to  Longevity  Heaven’s  benefit.  Senior  Fei,  how  can  we  produce   immortal  essence  stones?”</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  waved  his  hand  again:  ”No  rush,  no  rush,  listen  to  my  story.”</p>
<p>“When  we  produce  primeval  essence,  our  human  will  and  aperture  are   needed.  When  we  produce  immortal  essence,  our  human  will  and  immortal   aperture  are  needed.  To  produce  primeval  stones,  we  need  heaven’s  will  and   spirit  springs.  What  about  immortal  essence  stones?”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  blinked:  ”Do  we  also  need  heaven’s  will  and  immortal  apertures   or  immortal  springs  to  create  immortal  essence  stones?”</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  shook  his  head:  ”Many  rank  eight  Gu  Immortals  who  are  not   confident  of  passing  a  tribulation  will  annex  an  immemorial  nine  heavens   fragment.  From  then  on,  the  immortal  aperture  will  turn  into  a  grotto- heaven,  it  will  be  located  at  one  place  while  the  rank  eight  Gu  Immortal  will   be  like  a  caged  bird  unable  to  leave  the  immortal  aperture  again.  These   grotto-heavens  contain  heaven’s  will,  there  is  also  an  immortal  aperture,  so   why  can’t  immortal  essence  stones  be  produced?”</p>
<p>“As  for  heaven’s  will  and  immortal  springs?  This  is  something  that  people   have  been  speculating  about  Heavenly  Court,  they  think  that  Heavenly   Court  obtained  the  only  immortal  spring  in  the  world.  But  the  truth  is,  this   is  not  true.  There  is  no  such  thing  as  an  immortal  spring  in  the  world.”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  sighed:  ”Senior  Fei,  stop  beating  about  the  bush.”</p>
<p>Even  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  commented:  ”Tell  us  directly.”</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  did  not  dare  to  defy  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable,  he  sighed   regrettably  and  said:  ”Then  I’ll  cut  to  the  chase.”</p>
<p>“According  to  my  research,  the  essence  of  a  spirit  spring  is  just  an  ordinary   heaven  path  resource  point.  Within  it,  there  are  heaven  path,  water  path,  and   earth  path  dao  marks,  because  of  the  heaven’s  will,  the  spring  water  can   produce  solid  primeval  stones.”</p>
<p>“The  Heavenly  Dao  seeks  balance  of  the  myriad  beings,  it  will  not  produce   a  resource  like  immortal  essence  stones  naturally.  Immortal  essence  is  the   most  fundamental  resource,  without  it,  no  Immortal  Gu  can  be  used  by   people.  Meanwhile,  the  widespread  distribution  of  immortal  essence  stones   has  greatly  raised  the  chances  of  surviving  calamities  and  tribulations,  this   can  only  be  caused  by  people.”</p>
<p>“However,  the  process  cannot  avoid  heaven’s  will.  Only  through  the   injecting  of  heaven’s  will  can  there  be  immortal  essence  stones  produced.   This  is  an  impossible  loop.”</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  accurately  pointed  out  that  heaven’s  will  was  the  most  crucial   element  in  producing  immortal  essence  stones.</p>
<p>But  it  was  impossible  to  make  heaven’s  will  do  this  voluntarily  as  it   violated  the  rules  of  the  Heavenly  Dao.</p>
<p>But  nothing  was  absolute.</p>
<p>In  history,  Heavenly  Court  succeeded.</p>
<p>During  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable’s  era,  he  used  the  special  trait   of  Yi  Qi  Zi  to  produce  immortal  essence  stones.</p>
<p>During  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  era,  Yi  Qi  Zi  suicided  but   she  assimilated  with  the  Dao  and  altered  heaven’s  will,  allowing  it  to  work   with  Heavenly  Court  to  produce  immortal  essence  stones.</p>
<p>“So,  what  is  the  special  trait  of  Yi  Qi  Zi?  Since  it  suicided,  how  did  it   revive?”  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  asked  the  most  important  question.</p>
<p>Fei  Wu  immediately  answered:  ”Yi  Qi  Zi  is  not  its  full  name,  its  actual   name  is  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi.  It  is  a  very  special  legendary   immemorial  desolate  beast,  somewhat  similar  to  Di  Zang  Sheng  which   appeared  later  in  the  future.”</p>
<p>“When  a  Gu  Master  undergoes  immortal  ascension,  there  is  a  crucial  step  to   draw  in  heaven  and  earth  qi  to  mix  with  one’s  human  qi  and  balance  all   three.”</p>
<p>“If  the  balancing  of  three  qi  succeeds,  the  qi  lump  will  condense  and   become  smaller  until  it  reaches  the  limit.  This  qi  lump  is  known  as  the  Qi  of   Unified  Essence.”</p>
<p>“This  is  the  root  cause  of  the  creation  of  Unified  Essence  Yi  Qi  Zi!  As  long   as  there  are  Gu  Masters  undergoing  immortal  ascension  in  the  world,  they   will  produce  the  Qi  of  Unified  Essence,  even  if  it  is  destroyed,  it  can  be   reborn!”</p>
<p>“Initially,  during  the  immemorial  era,  it  was  granted  intelligence  by  a   beastman  great  expert.  Thus,  it  gained  an  immortal  aperture  and  rose  in   strength,  becoming  a  legendary  immemorial  beast.”</p>
<p>“When  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  challenged  the  various   variant  human  races,  Yi  Qi  Zi  fought  against  the  Immortal  Venerable  and   lost,  getting  captured.  But  to  the  outside  world,  Primordial  Origin  declared   that  it  was  killed.”</p>
<p>“Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  held  Yi  Qi  Zi  captive  and  used  it  to   produce  immortal  essence  stones.”</p>
<p>“Yi  Qi  Zi  lost  its  freedom,  unwilling  to  give  in,  it  tried  all  ways  to  escape.   No  matter  what  it  tried  to  do,  Primordial  Origin  Immortal  Venerable  still   foiled  its  plans.  After  him,  Star  Constellation  took  over.  She  was  even  more   skilled  at  planning  and  was  extremely  perceptive,  Yi  Qi  Zi  had  no  choice   but  to  suicide  out  of  despair.”</p>
<p>“This  is  the  reason  why  he  suicided  in  Heavenly  Court.”</p>
<p>Yao  Huang  did  not  understand  it:  ”So  how  are  they  still  producing  immortal   essence  stones?”</p>
<p>Brilliance  shone  in  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  eyes,  he  muttered:  ”So   that’s  it.”</p>
<p>At  this  moment,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  finally  understood  why   destined  birth  through  luck  revived  Fei  Wu.</p>
<p>This  was  because  his  revival  would  give  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  a   way  to  replenish  his  immortal  essence!</p>
<p>This  was  more  useful  and  beneficial  to  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  than   rank  nine  light  Gu.</p>
<p>But  luck  path  itself  was  an  uncertainty.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  could  ensure  that  positive  variables   happened  to  benefit  him,  but  he  could  not  control  the  exact  situation  as  that   would  involve  controlling  certainty.</p>
