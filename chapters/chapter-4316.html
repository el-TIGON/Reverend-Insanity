        <p>:  Trend  of  Immortal  Ascension</p>
<p>After  spectral  heaven  formed,  it  gradually  stabilized.  The  beast  groups  that   escaped  earlier  returned  and  lived  in  the  new  heaven  again.</p>
<p>All  the  various  grotto-heavens’  doors  were  tightly  shut  as  they  condensed   into  one  spot,  although  there  were  some  losses,  they  had  managed  to   survive  at  least.</p>
<p>Despite  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  dominance  of  spectral  heaven,  he   rarely  moved.</p>
<p>The  two  heavens’  grotto-heavens  tried  not  to  open  their  doors  and  connect   to  the  outside  world,  otherwise,  it  was  possible  that  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable  might  approach  them.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan,  Star  Constellation,  and  Giant  Sun  were  busy  refining  natural   dao  marks,  they  were  competing  with  each  other  as  they  fell  into  another   deadlock.</p>
<p>While  the  venerables  had  ceased  fire  and  everyone  gained  some  respite,  a   large  number  of  Gu  Immortal  seeds  started  to  prepare  for  the  attempt  at   immortal  ascension!</p>
<p>Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Lotus  Sect’s  headquarters.</p>
<p>“Mu  Huai  greets  first  supreme  elder.”  A  newly  advanced  rank  six  Gu   Immortal  knelt  on  the  ground  and  greeted.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Lotus  Sect’s  first  supreme  elder  nodded  and  gave  Mu  Huai  some   words  of  encouragement  before  telling  the  immortal  beside  him:  ”Wu   Zhang,  you  nurtured  Mu  Huai  so  you  will  be  the  one  making  arrangements   for  him  now.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”  Wu  Zhang  answered  as  he  brought  Mu  Huai  out  of  the  hall.</p>
<p>Wu  Zhang  was  the  fifth  supreme  elder  of  Heavenly  Lotus  Sect,  long  ago,  he   had  created  the  Five  Virtues  Sect  in  Central  Continent  under  his  own  name.</p>
<p>Five  Virtues  Sect  had  the  five  virtues  elders,  among  them,  Mu  Huai  was  the   wood  virtue  elder.</p>
<p>This  time,  he  took  a  risk  to  undergo  immortal  ascension  and  succeeded,   obtaining  a  medium  grade  blessed  land.  Wu  Zhang  brought  him  to   Heavenly  Lotus  Sect  as  he  gained  the  first  supreme  elder’s  recognition.</p>
<p>From  now  on,  Mu  Huai  was  a  member  of  Wu  Zhang’s  faction.</p>
<p>Days  later,  in  Northern  Plains.</p>
<p>An  immortal  ascension  had  just  ended.  Ouyang  Bi  Sang  only  had  half  of  his   body  remaining,  but  he  barely  survived.</p>
<p>“Second  brother,  you  succeeded!”  Mo  Shi  Kuang  shouted  loudly  as  he  ran   forward  in  excitement.</p>
<p>Ouyang  Bi  Sang  could  only  smile  as  he  could  not  speak,  he  looked  towards   Liu  Wen  Wu  with  a  grateful  gaze.</p>
<p>If  not  for  Liu  Wen  Wu’s  help,  Ouyang  Bi  Sang  would  have  definitely  died.</p>
<p>Right  now,  all  thanks  to  Liu  Wen  Wu’s  immortal  killer  move,  Ouyang  Bi   Sang  managed  to  survive.</p>
<p>Liu  Wen  Wu  was  once  Liu  tribe’s  Gu  Immortal  seed,  he  was  the  sworn   brother  of  Ouyang  Bi  Sang  and  Mo  Shi  Kuang,  they  had  participated  in  the   Imperial  Court  contest.</p>
<p>Liu  Wen  Wu  was  already  a  Gu  Immortal,  with  his  help,  Ouyang  Bi  Sang   also  succeeded.</p>
<p>Liu  Wen  Wu  understood  what  Ouyang  Bi  Sang  was  thinking,  he  smiled   gently:  ”Second  brother,  go  ahead  and  rest.  With  me  here,  you  will  be  safe.”</p>
<p>Ouyang  Bi  Sang  did  not  even  have  the  strength  to  nod,  he  shut  his  eyes  and   fell  asleep.  This  showed  how  much  trust  he  had  in  Liu  Wen  Wu.</p>
<p>“Big  brother!  Second  brother  has  already  succeeded  in  the  immortal   ascension,  I  can  do  it  too.  When  are  you  going  to  help  me?  I  want  to  try  it   too.”  Mo  Shi  Kuang  showed  a  heated  gaze  and  spoke  in  an  anxious  tone.</p>
<p>Liu  Wen  Wu  smiled  bitterly:  ”Third  brother,  calm  down.  You’ve  seen  what   happened  to  your  second  brother,  the  immortal  ascension  is  very  dangerous,   he  almost  failed  to  balance  the  three  qi  and  nearly  failed  completely.”</p>
<p>“With  just  my  help,  it  is  very  unreliable  to  try  and  go  through  the   unpredictable  immortal  ascension  calamities  and  tribulations.”</p>
<p>“We  were  lucky  this  time  because  the  calamities  and  tribulations  were   within  my  abilities.  But  you  need  to  know  that  there  are  all  kinds  of   tribulations,  by  the  time  you  undergo  immortal  ascension,  we  may  not  be  so   lucky.”</p>
<p>“This…”  Mo  Shi  Kuang  scratched  his  head.</p>
<p>Liu  Wen  Wu  added:  ”Let’s  wait  a  while  for  your  second  brother’s   cultivation  level  to  stabilize.  Once  he  has  some  immortal  methods,  we  can   work  together  to  help  you,  that  will  be  safer.”</p>
<p>“Brother,  you  are  right,  I’ll  wait.”  Mo  Shi  Kuang  agreed  with  the  words  and   changed  his  decision.</p>
<p>But  he  did  not  know  that  Liu  Wen  Wu  was  sighing  internally.</p>
<p>Long  ago,  Liu  Wen  Wu  was  just  a  Gu  Master,  he  did  not  have  such  a  wide   vision,  thus,  he  became  sworn  brothers  with  Mo  Shi  Kuang.</p>
<p>But  after  becoming  a  Gu  Immortal,  he  realized  that  the  world  was  ruled  by   humanity,  all  variant  humans  were  marginalized.</p>
<p>Mo  Shi  Kuang’s  inkman  identity  was  increasingly  sensitive.</p>
<p>After  Liu  Wen  Wu  helped  Ouyang  Bi  Sang  to  become  an  immortal,  the   latter  would  become  Liu  tribe’s  external  supreme  elder.  He  would  be  Liu   Wen  Wu’s  supporter  and  stand  on  the  same  political  side  as  him.</p>
<p>Even  though  Ouyang  Bi  Sang  was  a  purebred  human,  Liu  tribe’s  other   factions  still  attacked  them  —</p>
<p>Why  was  Liu  Wen  Wu  helping  an  external  member  instead  of  nurturing  Liu   tribe’s  own  Gu  Masters?</p>
<p>If  Mo  Shi  Kuang  became  an  immortal  through  Liu  Wen  Wu’s  help,  it  would   be  an  even  worse  situation  when  he  becomes  a  member  of  his  political   faction.</p>
<p>This  would  be  a  weakness  for  the  other  factions  to  target!</p>
<p>Sometimes,  Liu  Wen  Wu  envied  the  ten  great  ancient  sects  of  Central   Continent.</p>
<p>The  supreme  elders  of  these  ancient  sects  were  able  to  create  their  own   sects  under  their  personal  name  to  gather  and  distribute  Central  Continent’s   resource  points.  If  they  were  able  to  nurture  Gu  Immortals,  then  those   would  become  their  subordinates  or  companions.</p>
<p>This  was  a  superb  political  method  by  the  ten  great  ancient  sects  to  control   Central  Continent.</p>
<p>But  this  could  not  work  in  the  super  clan  dominated  regions.  Creating  one’s   own  force  was  too  much  of  a  taboo.</p>
<p>Like  in  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  lifetime,  he  wanted  a  hereditary   monarchy,  he  wanted  to  unify  and  rule  the  entire  world.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea’s  Hua  Ben  Ku,  Central  Continent’s  Mu  Huai,  and  Northern   Plains’  Ouyang  Bi  Sang…</p>
<p>With  the  deep  foundation  of  the  super  forces,  they  knew  the  secrets  behind   immortal  ascension,  thus,  many  of  their  Gu  Immortal  seeds  were  quickly   using  the  opportunity  to  ascend.</p>
<p>Southern  Border.</p>
<p>“Oh  no!”  Yi  Peng  had  a  grim  expression,  he  watched  as  the  heaven,  earth   and  human  qi  lost  their  balance.</p>
<p>Within  the  qi  lump,  Gu  Master  Yi  Chong  failed  the  immortal  ascension,  by   the  time  the  three  qi  lump  dispersed,  he  was  almost  reduced  to  a  stick,  his   arms  and  legs  were  gone,  his  entire  body  was  a  bloody  mess.</p>
<p>Calamities  and  tribulations  could  be  resisted  by  allies,  but  the  balancing  of   three  qi  was  something  that  only  the  Gu  Master  could  handle,  no  one  else   could  help.</p>
<p>“Sigh,  you  were  too  immersed  in  the  natural  inspiration.  I  already  told  you   not  to  be  greedy!”  Yi  Peng  landed  beside  Yi  Chong  and  sighed  regrettably.</p>
<p>Yi  Chong  did  not  move,  after  a  few  breaths  of  time,  he  died.</p>
<p>Half  a  month  later.</p>
<p>On  an  unknown  mountain  in  Central  Continent,  Ben  Duo  Yi  succeeded  in   the  immortal  ascension.</p>
<p>“I’ve  finally  become  a  rank  six  Gu  Immortal.”  He  had  a  complex  emotion,   while  he  felt  joy  and  excitement,  there  was  also  regret.</p>
<p>In  order  to  resist  the  calamities  and  tribulations  while  balancing  the  three  qi,   he  gave  up  on  the  chance  of  natural  inspiration.</p>
<p>Ben  Duo  Yi’s  master  was  Yu  Mu  Chun,  a  refinement  path  quasi-great   grandmaster,  and  also  a  member  of  Shadow  Sect.  From  this  aspect,  Ben   Duo  Yi  was  also  a  remnant  of  Shadow  Sect.</p>
<p>He  was  chosen  by  Yu  Mu  Chun  due  to  his  exceptional  talent.  Ben  Duo  Yi   was  more  witty  than  the  average  hairy  man,  he  had  clear  thoughts  and  did   not  lose  to  humans  in  terms  of  spirituality.</p>
<p>This  successful  immortal  ascension  also  proved  that  Yu  Mu  Chun  had  great   foresight.</p>
<p>After  cleaning  up,  Ben  Duo  Yi  quickly  left  the  mountain.</p>
<p>Not  long  after,  a  Gu  Immortal  arrived  at  this  place.</p>
<p>“This  is  it.”</p>
<p>“The  star  array  calculation  formation  showed  that  someone  underwent   tribulation  here.”</p>
<p>“Oh?  Seems  like  a  lone  cultivator.”</p>
<p>After  inspecting,  this  Gu  Immortal  obtained  some  clearer  clues.</p>
<p>His  eyes  started  to  shine.</p>
<p>The  immortal  ascension  of  lone  cultivators  was  very  difficult,  since  they   succeeded,  it  meant  that  they  were  very  valuable.</p>
<p>“If  I  can  recruit  this  person  successfully,  I  will  earn  a  huge  sum  of   contribution  points.  This  person  can  also  be  in  my  faction  in  the  future.”</p>
<p>Places  with  people  would  have  competition  for  benefits,  leading  to  conflict.</p>
<p>As  long  as  the  internal  conflict  of  a  sect  was  well  managed,  it  would  be  a   great  system  for  eliminating  the  weak  and  nurturing  the  strong.</p>
<p>The  sect  higher-ups  were  willing  to  see  this.</p>
<p>However,  this  Gu  Immortal  did  not  know  that  the  person  undergoing   tribulation  was  not  a  purebred  human  but  a  hairy  man.</p>
<p>Ben  Duo  Yi’s  immortal  ascension  was  just  one  of  countless  others.</p>
<p>First,  the  five  regions’  super  forces’  Gu  Immortal  seeds  made  their  attempt,   afterwards,  lone  immortals  and  demonic  cultivators  also  gave  it  a  shot.</p>
<p>Gradually,  the  trend  of  immortal  ascension  was  formed.</p>
<p>The  immortal  ascension  trend  involved  the  righteous  path,  demonic   cultivator,  and  even  lone  cultivators.  Many  lone  cultivators  like  Ben  Duo  Yi   emerged  and  showed  themselves,  surprising  the  world  with  their   appearance.</p>
<p>The  super  forces  of  the  five  regions  were  also  involved.  Among  super   forces,  there  was  even  some  hidden  competition!</p>
<p>Tie  clan’s  Tie  Ruo  Nan  became  a  rank  six  metal  path  Gu  Immortal.</p>
<p>Shang  clan’s  Shang  Xin  Ci  succeeded  in  her  immortal  ascension.</p>
<p>Two  of  Western  Desert’s  Lin  clan’s  Gu  Masters  became  immortals  at  the   same  time.</p>
<p>Eastern  Sea’s  Nan  Gong  clan  did  not  fall  behind,  in  just  seven  days,  two  Gu   Masters  took  a  risk  and  succeeded,  they  both  had  considerable  gains.</p>
<p>Next,  Southern  Border’s  Tie  clan  spread  joyous  news  again.</p>
<p>The  revived  Tie  Mu  Bai  and  Tie  Bai  Qi  both  succeeded  in  their  immortal   ascension.</p>
<p>The  one  that  shocked  the  five  regions’  Gu  Immortal  world  the  most  was   Southern  Border’s  Wu  clan.</p>
<p>Wu  clan’s  Zhong  Yi,  Wu  Shen  Tong,  Divine  Doctor  Sheng  Shou,  Wei  Shen   Jing,  and  others  became  rank  six  Gu  Immortals,  there  were  a  total  of  nine   people  who  succeeded,  this  was  the  number  one  record  in  the  five  regions!</p>
<p>Wu  clan  was  lacking  Gu  Immortals  previously,  but  under  Wu  Yong’s   reform,  they  took  in  a  large  number  of  external  elders.</p>
<p>With  these  Gu  Immortals’  presence,  Wu  clan  immediately  became  the   Southern  Border’s  super  force  with  the  most  number  of  Gu  Immortals!</p>
<p>Immediately,  all  sorts  of  congratulatory  letters  from  various  forces  were   sent  to  Wu  Yong  via  treasure  yellow  heaven  or  information  path  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>Wu  clan  gained  a  huge  amount  of  fame  but  Wu  Yong  only  snickered  coldly   without  feeling  happy  at  all.</p>
<p>“Such  celebrations  are  just  a  form  of  self-consolation  for  the  chaotic  future   under  the  rule  of  the  venerables.  So  what  if  we  have  more  Gu  Immortals,   can  we  be  safe?  Against  the  venerables,  we  are  all  ants.”</p>
<p>“Moreover,  in  terms  of  numbers,  Heavenly  Court,  Longevity  Heaven,  and   the  Heaven  and  Earth  Great  Love  Alliance  definitely  have  the  most  number   of  immortal  ascensions.  They  are  huge  and  possess  too  many  super  forces   under  them.”</p>
<p>Wu  Yong  was  extremely  clear  of  the  situation.</p>
<p>He  knew  that  the  true  trial  was  not  the  number  of  successful  immortal   ascensions,  it  was  the  huge  impact  that  these  new  external  supreme  elders   would  cause  after  joining  Wu  clan,  when  they  go  against  the  traditional   factions  that  had  been  long  established  through  time.</p>
<p>As  the  first  supreme  elder  of  Wu  clan,  Wu  Yong  needed  to  maintain  the   stability  of  the  clan,  if  there  was  too  many  internal  conflicts,  they  would   weaken  themselves.  In  that  case,  he  might  as  well  not  implement  this   change.</p>
<p>Central  Continent.</p>
<p>Xiao  Qi  Xing  descended  from  the  sky.  There  was  some  dust  on  his  white   robe.</p>
<p>His  eyebrows  were  sharp  like  swords,  his  body  was  straight  like  a  spear,  his   expression  was  cold  and  he  gave  off  an  aura  of  pride.</p>
<p>“Good,  good,  good.”  Gu  Immortal  Xiao  Bai  Hong  laughed  as  he  stroked  his   beard,  looking  at  Xiao  Qi  Xing  with  a  gaze  of  appreciation:  ”As  expected  of   my  beloved  great-grandson.  You  went  through  the  immortal  ascension   without  external  help.”</p>
<p>Xiao  Qi  Xing  replied:  ”Great-grandfather,  this  is  nothing  to  be  proud  of.   Many  lone  cultivators  could  achieve  it,  so  why  can’t  I?  Rank  six  is  merely   the  starting  point.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha,  well  said!”  Xiao  Bai  Hong’s  laughter  became  even  louder.</p>
<p>Next,  Xiao  Qi  Xing  asked  the  other  nine  children  of  human  path.</p>
<p>“What?  Sun  Yuan  Hua,  Gu  Ting,  and  the  rest  became  rank  six  Gu   Immortals  but  did  not  refine  their  vital  Gu  into  an  Immortal  Gu?”</p>
<p>“Hehe,  they  are  really  trash!”</p>
<p>Different  from  the  others,  the  immortal  ascension  of  the  ten  children  of   human  path  were  kept  secret.</p>
<p>They  were  the  key  to  developing  human  path  in  Central  Continent,  they   were  the  future  pillars  of  human  path.  Before  they  grew  to  a  certain  level,  it   was  better  to  let  them  grow  safely.</p>
<p>Some  succeeded  in  their  immortal  ascension,  some  died  while  taking  risks.</p>
<p>Some  made  their  ancestors  proud,  their  names  were  spread  throughout  the   world,  while  some  kept  quiet  and  developed  earnestly,  keeping  a  low   profile.</p>
<p>Some  did  not  try  to  undergo  immortal  ascension,  like  Feng  Jin  Huang.</p>
<p>Some  did  not  even  have  the  qualification  to  try,  for  example,  Southern   Border’s  Xia  Cha  and  Ba  Shi  Ba.</p>
<p>There  were  also  some  who  were  preparing  to  undergo  immortal  ascension,   like  Western  Desert’s  Mo  Li,  and  sovereign  immortal  aperture’s  Gu  Yue   Fang  Xiang.</p>
