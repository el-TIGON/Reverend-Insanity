    <h1>Chapter 2263</h1>
    <p>: Selling to the Point of Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Tie Qu Zhong nodded his head repeatedly, he looked at Tie Ruo Nan with an unconcealed gaze of appreciation.</p>
<p>Previously, when Tie Qu Zhong heard that Tie Mian Shen chose Tie Ruo Nan to inherit the Iron Mask true inheritance, he had some doubts.</p>
<p>But over this period of interaction, Tie Qu Zhong fully approved of Tie Ruo Nan, he felt that she was the rising star with most potential in this generation.</p>
<p>“Tie Ruo Nan, it is great that you have such a deep awareness of the situation.”</p>
<p>“Fang Yuan is evil, he seized my immortal aperture and forced me to use second aperture to cultivate, causing me to be dependent on him. My future is ruined, my prospects are bleak. But you have bright prospects. Your current accumulation is already enough to undergo immortal ascension!” Tie Qu Zhong said in a gratified tone.</p>
<p>Tie Ruo Nan did not pretend to be modest: “Yes. I was in closed cultivation inside Demon Suppression Tower recently, I have consulted many seniors in the clan regarding their immortal ascension experience, I am 80-90% confident in passing the immortal ascension!”</p>
<p>“Good. But you need to slow down a little. The two heavens are merging, causing constant turbulence and heaven’s will to be chaotic, you will suffer losses if you undergo immortal ascension at this time. The opportunity of natural inspiration comes only once in a lifetime, but it is very important.” Tie Qu Zhong instructed.</p>
<p>“Oh? I would like to hear the details.”</p>
<p>Tie Qu Zhong explained: “In the process of natural inspiration, a Gu cultivator can question heaven’s will and obtain an answer. If the question is too difficult and surpasses the limits of heaven and earth, you won’t obtain any answer.”</p>
<p>“For instance, if you ask for a method of eternal life during natural inspiration, heaven and earth has no way to answer you.”</p>
<p>“If the question is too simple, the Gu cultivator can obtain an answer, but they will not be making the best use of this precious opportunity. That will be extremely unfortunate.”</p>
<p>“The ideal situation is to ask a question of moderate difficulty and obtain a perfect answer. But this situation is too rare, and we have no way to grasp it.”</p>
<p>“So, the most mature method is to ask a slightly more difficult question. As such, the answer will be correct but not complete as it will be lacking a small portion.”</p>
<p>“The remaining portion can be completed through deductions using manpower and material resources in the future.”</p>
<p>“This is the most effective way to use natural inspiration.”</p>
<p>Tie Ruo Nan’s eyes shined as she asked: “Then how can I judge the difficulty of these questions?”</p>
<p>“Generally speaking, asking about Immortal Gu recipes of common rank seven Immortal Gu is the standard for this. Any Gu worms related to <<The Legends of Ren Zu>> are not ordinary Gu.”</p>
<p>“Besides this, ask about things closely related to you. For instance, you cultivate metal path, ask questions relating to metal path. But if you ask about earth path or other paths, the effect will be low. And you need to be very careful if you want to ask about things relating to dream path.”</p>
<p>At the same time.</p>
<p>Southern Border.</p>
<p>Iron Tooth Mountain.</p>
<p>In a nameless cave.</p>
<p>Wu Yong cupped his fists and greeted with a smile: “I brought some good wine this time.”</p>
<p>In front of Wu Yong was an old Gu Immortal. He was sitting cross-legged on the ground, he slowly opened his eyes like he had just woken up.</p>
<p>The old man sighed: “Lord Wu Yong, this is the third time you have paid me a visit. You are a rank eight Gu cultivator, the alliance leader of Southern Alliance, but have given such special treatment to a mere rank seven Gu Immortal like me.”</p>
<p>“I understand your intention, but I only want to cultivate in seclusion, I have no wish to participate in the struggles and conflicts of the world.”</p>
<p>“Your wine is fragrant, but I don’t have the fortune to enjoy it.”</p>
<p>This old man was a secluded cultivator, he cultivated wisdom path and was called Forgotten Daoist.</p>
<p>Wu clan specialized in wind path, they had no advantages in wisdom path.</p>
<p>Wu Yong had been looking for reliable talents. When he learned that Forgotten Daoist was living on Iron Tooth Mountain, he personally visited three times to recruit him.</p>
<p>Wu Yong said grimly: “Friend, you are wrong. Right now, the two heavens are merging, the war of the five regions is almost before us. Who can possibly stay out of it?”</p>
<p>“Even if you are unwilling to conflict with others, in this chaotic world, there are always people who want to cause trouble, like Western Desert’s Fang clan.”</p>
<p>“With some support from Fang Yuan, Fang clan decisively invaded Wan clan, causing Wan clan’s first supreme elder to perish in battle.”</p>
<p>“This is the signal of the upcoming chaotic world.”</p>
<p>“Even if Heavenly Court supported Wan clan to victory, what is the main difference between Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Fang Yuan?”</p>
<p>“As a wisdom path Gu cultivator, you must have understood it.”</p>
<p>Forgotten Daoist heaved a long sigh: “It is better to be a dog during peaceful times, than a man involved in brutal chaos. In the present world, Great Love Immortal Venerable, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable are leading an ultimate force of a region each. They have robust foundation, they can easily topple the balance between super forces. As for you, Wu Yong, you can hardly restrain your excitement and urge to make a move, but I can only see misery in this.”</p>
<p>“Lord Wu Yong, you don’t need to urge me anymore, please leave.”</p>
<p>Wu Yong sighed, he could only hold his expectations for the future. After looking at Forgotten Daoist, he left while feeling it was a deep pity.</p>
<p>This world was huge.</p>
<p>There was Shi Zhong who worked hard and tried to refine Immortal Gu, there was also Xiao Qi Xing who used his great-grandfather’s help to attempt a rank seven vital Gu even before advancing to Gu Immortal.</p>
<p>There was Nu Er Tu, who already advanced to a Gu Immortal with the clan’s help, there was also a Gu Master, Tie Ruo Nan, who cultivated metal path, she obtained her senior’s guidance and learned of the secret of natural inspiration.</p>
<p>There was Wu Yong with great ambition, and also Forgotten Daoist, who was content with living in seclusion and was unwilling to get involved in disputes.</p>
<p>And finally, there was a super force whose future was dark and currently faced a precarious situation — Fang clan.</p>
<p>In Fang clan headquarters.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was heavy in the discussion hall.</p>
<p>Fang clan lost.</p>
<p>Their losses were severe!</p>
<p>What should they do?</p>
<p>Be it Fang Gong, Fang Di Chang, or Fang Leng and Fang Yun, their mood was extremely heavy.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou reclaimed all the lost territories of Wan clan, but the anti- Fang alliance was still there.</p>
<p>If not for the alliance discussing the distribution of spoils, they would have already attacked Fang clan.</p>
<p>Although Fang clan still had the strength to fight, their hope of winning was negligible.</p>
<p>Right at this time, Lu Wei Yin suddenly paid a visit.</p>
<p>The Fang clan immortals were moved.</p>
<p>“Quick, invite him in!” Fang Gong had just finished speaking, when he stood up, “No, come with me, we will welcome him together.”</p>
<p>Fang clan’s immortals invited Lu Wei Yin into the hall.</p>
<p>Lu Wei Yin saw the dejected expressions of Fang clan immortals: “Everlasting sorrow is indeed an amazing killer move. According to what I know, everlasting sorrow is a compound killer move created from time path and wisdom path. Once the target’s feelings are influenced by this killer move, their lifespan will decrease rapidly. The decreased lifespan will</p>
<p>strengthen the killer move’s power, making the sorrowful emotions even more violent. The emotions will shroud the heart, and the target’s battle intent will fall to a minimum.”</p>
<p>Fang Hua Sheng sighed: “This killer move is a lot different from the historical records. I tried my best to treat it, but there are still many negative emotions left in our hearts, they can only dissipate slowly with time.”</p>
<p>Lu Wei Yin laughed: “Don’t worry, I brought a special Immortal Gu this time, please try it.”</p>
<p>Saying so, he gave an Immortal Gu to Fang Di Chang.</p>
<p>This was a rank seven wisdom path Immortal Gu.</p>
<p>After Fang Di Chang activated it with much difficulty, the Immortal Gu let out a profound light that covered his whole body.</p>
<p>After a while, Fang Di Chang recovered his mental state. His body was relaxed and the sorrowful emotions that shrouded his heart were already gone.</p>
<p>“This is a good Immortal Gu.” Fang Di Chang praised.</p>
<p>Lu Wei Yin continued his words: “My alliance leader knows of Fang clan’s defeat, so he specially refined this Immortal Gu. With this wisdom path Immortal Gu, it is easy to remove the remnant power of the killer move everlasting sorrow.”</p>
<p>“Besides this Immortal Gu, there are also several killer moves with it as the core. One of them can even defend against everlasting sorrow, albeit with difficulty.”</p>
<p>“You only need to pay a super resource point to buy them all.”</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang smiled bitterly and was about to speak.</p>
<p>But Lu Wei Yin added: “No need to grieve, my friends. I know Fang clan lost Fang Dong Xi and Fang An Lei in this battle. This is a disastrous loss</p>
<p>for Fang clan!”</p>
<p>“But no worries. Heavenly Court has methods to revive Wan Gu Chou, how can my Lord Fang Yuan not have them?”</p>
<p>“You only need to pay two giant resource points for Lord Alliance Leader to revive those two, but their cultivation will be at rank six.”</p>
<p>This time, the Fang clan immortals’ expressions changed.</p>
<p>“Really? Can An Lei really be revived?” Fang Chen was very excited.</p>
<p>He was Fang clan’s son-in-law, Fang An Lei was his wife.</p>
<p>Lu Wei Yin smiled: “In the previous transactions with your clan, there was one transaction which asked for your human qi. These portions of human qi are the key to reviving you.”</p>
<p>“There are no issues with the revival. Not only this, there is also no issue with restoring the cultivation of those two to rank seven. You just need to add two additional giant resource points.”</p>
<p>“Naturally, if you want those two’s cultivation to be raised to rank eight, that is also possible. As long as you can afford it, with the vast powers of our Lord Alliance Leader, you will not be disappointed.”</p>
<p>“Even rank eight cultivation level can be transacted?” Fang Gong was stunned.</p>
<p>The other Fang clan Gu Immortals had complicated expressions.</p>
<p>Rank eight cultivation level had once been the highest achievement, but in the last few decades, pseudo venerables took the stage one after the other, venerables also started reviving. The status of rank eight cultivation fell again and again.</p>
<p>Now, rank eight cultivation had become a commodity to be transacted at will!</p>
<p>This made the Fang clan immortals become somewhat dazed.</p>
<p>Lu Wei Yin looked around and asked: “You still don’t get it? The world has already undergone an intense change ever since the destruction of fate Gu.”</p>
<p>“This is true for Immortal Gu Houses, rank eight Gu Immortals, and even venerables.”</p>
<p>“This change can be said to completely flip societal norms, even super forces will only be a ripple in the waves of time if they cannot adapt to this change, wiped out in just a moment.”</p>
<p>Fang Di Chang narrowed his eyes: “Lord Lu Wei Yin, you seem to have another meaning behind your words.”</p>
<p>Lu Wei Yin chuckled: “I will be direct then, your situation is very dangerous, how will Fang clan defend against the anti-Fang alliance?”</p>
<p>“If you just defend, no matter how much more powerful the immortal formation you possess, you will only be delaying your destruction.”</p>
<p>“You can only deal with this intense change by taking drastic measures!”</p>
<p>“Naturally, the choice belongs to you. Lord Alliance Leader will not personally interfere in Western Desert’s internal battle. But if I were you, I would sell all the resource points to exchange for Immortal Gu, immortal materials, and revive Fang clan’s Gu Immortals.”</p>
<p>Fang Gong’s and Fang Di Chang’s pupils shrunk slightly.</p>
<p>The remaining Gu Immortals were in an uproar.</p>
<p>“How can we do that? Such an action is too unfilial.”</p>
<p>“Our Fang clan’s foundation will be gone without these resource points.”</p>
<p>“If we do this, how can we face our ancestors when we die?!”</p>
<p>“This is my Fang clan’s foundation!”</p>
<p>The Fang clan immortals reacted agitatedly, looking at Lu Wei Yin with hatred and ferocity.</p>
<p>Lu Wei Yin shrugged his shoulders, saying calmly: “Whether you sell or not, it is up to you. I am only giving a small suggestion.”</p>
<p>“We will sell.” Fang Di Chang’s voice was extremely hoarse.</p>
<p>Fang Gong did not retort, he kept silent.</p>
<p>“Lord Fang Di Chang!!” Some Fang clan Gu Immortals stood up in agitation.</p>
<p>But Fang Di Chang’s next sentence silenced these Gu Immortals completely.</p>
<p>“If we don’t sell the resource points, are you able to defend them?”</p>
