        <p>: New Anti-Fang Alliance</p>
<p>Wang Xiao Er woke up from his sleep.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t I imprisoned? Where am I now?” Wang Xiao Er was puzzled, he found that he was in a vast wasteland.</p>
<p>“Quickly, escape!”</p>
<p>“Escape, escape!”</p>
<p>A large wave of humans suddenly surged out.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>With a loud sound, lightning struck the ground.</p>
<p>Following that, the earth and mountains shook. Explosions occurred loudly as the ground began to collapse.</p>
<p>In ten or so breaths of time, the surrounding ten li had become a giant crater.</p>
<p>The crater enclosed all the people including Wang Xiao Er.</p>
<p>Wang Xiao Er was dazed as he was sandwiched between the crowd.</p>
<p>The surrounding people were in disorder and panic, Wang Xiao Er also had the same feelings.</p>
<p>He did not know what happened.</p>
<p>Before this, he was captured by Fang Dong Xi in Sand Heap blessed land. Fang Dong Xi soul searched him and obtained information regarding Hu</p>
<p>Land.</p>
<p>During the contest over Sand Heap blessed land, Fang Dong Xi lost his soul cores. Fortunately, Fang Dong Xi captured Wang Xiao Er and obtained the secret information regarding Hu Land.</p>
<p>Fang Dong Xi used this precious information to make up for his mistake. On another hand, he also learned of the peculiarity of Wang Xiao Er’s body.</p>
<p>Fang Dong Xi imprisoned Wang Xiao Er in his immortal aperture, and specially constructed an underground prison. He studied and experimented on Wang Xiao Er’s body many times, but still did not understand what was going on with Wang Xiao Er’s body.</p>
<p>“All of you, shut up!” A figure suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>
<p>Wang Xiao Er and others looked up.</p>
<p>“Your ancestor Fang Dong Xi has already died in battle, everything is now all my, Xiao Ye Hu’s, property. You are also my captives! Stay here, I will make sure you live a life worse than death if you dare to escape!”</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu’s expression was cold and malevolent.</p>
<p>The chaotic crowd was shivering like a cicada under his threat.</p>
<p>Fang Dong Xi and Fang An Lei died in battle to protect Fang Di Chang. They were both rank seven Gu Immortals, their immortal apertures fell to the ground and opened to absorb heaven and earth qi, becoming unowned blessed lands.</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu took the chance to enter and plunder his battle spoils.</p>
<p>But the plundered resources did not satisfy Xiao Ye Hu.</p>
<p>His loss was extremely severe, his Immortal Gu House Chamber Pot was destroyed by Fang Gong. Even emptying Fang Dong Xi’s immortal aperture only made up for a meager amount of the losses.</p>
<p>“This won’t do, Wan clan must give me an answer!” Xiao Ye Hu’s expression was unsightly. After he stabilized Dong Xi blessed land’s situation, he quickly left to look for Wan clan.</p>
<p>At this time, the anti-Fang alliance had already succeeded in regaining the blessed land of Wan clan’s headquarters.</p>
<p>The anti-Fang alliance immortals were resting here for the moment.</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu went up to a hall, he restrained his unsightly expression and said loudly: “Senior Wan Gu Chou, I, Junior Xiao Ye Hu, am here as Xiao clan’s representative. Please meet me, we need to discuss some matters.”</p>
<p>Times had changed.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou suddenly revived and defeated Fang clan. Her impressive might shook the whole of Western Desert’s Gu Immortal world.</p>
<p>In front of such an expert, Xiao Ye Hu had to restrain himself.</p>
<p>Soon, Xiao Ye Hu received permission. He entered the hall and saw Wan Gu Chou sitting on the main seat.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou was wearing a white garment, her hair was silvery white, she looked quite old.</p>
<p>Wan Hao Guang was standing to her left, with Wan Xiao on her right.</p>
<p>“Hehehe.” She looked at Xiao Ye Hu and laughed, her laughter was hoarse and terrifying: “Junior from Xiao clan, you came at the right time. I have something to discuss with you. Take a seat and wait for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Xiao Ye Hu did not dare to retort, he chose a seat to sit.</p>
<p>After a short while, other anti-Fang alliance Gu Immortals were also invited into the hall.</p>
<p>Even Heavenly Court’s two Gu Immortals, Wan Zi Hong and Zhou Xiong Xin, were present.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou looked around and said: “Although Fang clan was defeated, they stole many of my clan’s resource points. My Wan clan is unable to pay the price agreed upon with your clans.”</p>
<p>“But, this is a huge opportunity for us.”</p>
<p>“Fang clan suffered a heavy loss, their strength has fallen sharply. As long as we give chase, Fang clan will not be able to defend. They have fallen to the demonic path, we must get rid of them! At that time, we will all get a share of the battle spoils.”</p>
<p>The immortals felt a chill as they listened.</p>
<p>This Wan Gu Chou was so shameless, directly saying she did not have a way to pay them, forcing the anti-Fang alliance to continue fighting.</p>
<p>Her methods were also vicious, she wanted to follow up the victory by giving chase and eradicating Fang clan.</p>
<p>But this was indeed a good opportunity.</p>
<p>The immortals were moved.</p>
<p>Fang clan sold a large number of Wan clan’s resource points, but sold very few of their own resource points. Their foundation was still there.</p>
<p>Now was the perfect time to beat them down.</p>
<p>“Wan clan is sinister, they deliberately concealed Wan Gu Chou and kept us in dark.”</p>
<p>“Wan Gu Chou kept on hiding, she only made a move when we crumbled. And with just one move, she defeated Fang clan, creating the current situation which is most favorable to Wan clan!”</p>
<p>“On the surface, Wan clan transacted the most with Xiao clan, in reality, their biggest collaborator is Heavenly Court!”</p>
<p>None of the immortals here were stupid, they had already realized the situation.</p>
<p>If Wan Gu Chou had made a move earlier, even if the anti-Fang alliance defeated Fang clan, most of the battle merits would belong to the alliance Gu Immortals.</p>
<p>But Wan Gu Chou made a move only at the final juncture, immediately revitalizing Wan clan’s prestige. The alliance immortals did not have the qualifications to talk of their merits or shamelessly ask for payment.</p>
<p>“We need to eradicate evil completely. Fang clan broke the rules, what right does such a demonic super clan have to continue existing in Western Desert’s Gu Immortal world?”</p>
<p>“I agree with Senior Wan Gu Chou’s plan.”</p>
<p>“But we should discuss how we distribute the spoils.”</p>
<p>The immortals had participated in the previous large battle, they all suffered losses, some needed to urgently make up for them, like Xiao Ye Hu. Some thought that since they had to undergo danger, they might as well reap benefits.</p>
<p>Seeing the Gu Immortals expressing their agreement, Wan Gu Chou looked at the two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals: “Heavenly Court has been the leader of humanity since ancient times, the banner of the righteous path. We will need your help in this battle.”</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou was deeply aware: Compared to Western Desert’s Gu Immortals, Heavenly Court’s financial support was much more important.</p>
<p>Without Heavenly Court’s support, Wan clan had no way to attack Fang clan.</p>
<p>Wan clan would have to pay a lot to collaborate with Heavenly Court, but the gains were also equally great.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou herself was revived by Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>Right now, a lot of her rank eight time path Immortal Gu were lent by Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>Even her everlasting sorrow killer move was personally modified by Star Constellation Immortal Venerable!</p>
<p>Zhou Xiong Xin and Wan Zi Hong glanced at each other, all the development so far did not exceed Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s calculations.</p>
<p>This was also the moment that these two Heavenly Court immortals were waiting for.</p>
<p>At the next moment, Zhou Xiong Xin stood up: “Friends of Western Desert, it is my Heavenly Court duty to eliminate the demonic path, we are very happy to support you.”</p>
<p>“Right now, Fang clan’s calamity is in front of them. Why did they have such guts to attack the alliance? The true underlying issue is not Fang clan, but Eastern Sea’s Heaven Refining Demon Venerable!”</p>
<p>“Heavenly Court is willing to continue to support you, but our condition is that you are not allowed to join the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance!”</p>
<p>The hall fell into silence as Gu Immortals looked at each other.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou broke the silence: “My Wan clan agrees!”</p>
<p>Wan clan had already become Heavenly Court’s supporter through the anti- Fang battle.</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou spoke: “Xiao Ye Hu, what do you think?”</p>
<p>Xiao Ye Hu’s expression was quite unsightly. Wan Gu Chou intentionally picked his name and forced him into a corner. He had no choice but to state his position.</p>
<p>He snorted coldly: “I, Xiao Ye Hu, am obviously not willing to associate with the demonic path, but that is just my individual stance. How can I casually represent my Xiao clan in agreeing to this? I have to ask for guidance from my Xiao clan’s first supreme elder!”</p>
<p>It was a delaying tactic.</p>
<p>But Zhou Xiong Xin had already expected it: “Then, Xiao Ye Hu, please contact your clan’s leading Gu Immortals right now. I believe that the difference between righteous and demonic is deeply rooted in people’s hearts. Xiao clan is one of the role models of Western Desert’s righteous path, you will not make a mistake in this major matter.”</p>
<p>Wan Gu Chou immediately nodded, echoing Heavenly Court immortals: “Let’s do it like this, friends, please ask for guidance from your clan’s leaders, and we will then discuss the matter of the distribution of spoils.”</p>
<p>She pretended to be tolerant: “If any clan is not willing, we will not criticize them. In this anti-Fang battle, you do not have any merits but you worked hard. If you don’t want to continue in the anti-Fang alliance, my Wan clan will bid you farewell and won’t make things difficult for you.”</p>
<p>The immortals cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>They had not gotten any payment, or maybe only a small portion of it.</p>
<p>If they did not agree to Heavenly Court’s condition, Wan Gu Chou was going to drive them away from the anti-Fang alliance.</p>
<p>Only if they were in the anti-Fang alliance could they get their payment as well as the battle spoils in the upcoming battle against Fang clan.</p>
<p>A while later.</p>
<p>The Gu Immortals finished asking for instructions. No one left.</p>
<p>Under the pressure of righteousness, Western Desert’s super clans could not risk going against public opinion and leaving the alliance.</p>
<p>Moreover, if they left the alliance at this point, they could not get any benefits.</p>
<p>Fang clan was like a piece of fat meat that lured these colossal vultures.</p>
<p>“Good, you have not let me down!” Wan Gu Chou stood up and said with a smile.</p>
<p>Right now, a new opportunity lay before her.</p>
<p>She was now the alliance leader of the anti-Fang alliance. As long as she led the alliance and defeated Fang clan, her reputation would rise to the peak of Western Desert’s Gu Immortal world.</p>
<p>At that time, she would be like Wu Yong, becoming the publicly recognized leader of the Western Desert Gu Immortal world.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiong Xin and Wan Zi Hong were smiling.</p>
<p>This was all within Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s calculations.</p>
<p>It was very advantageous for Heavenly Court to help Wan Gu Chou become the leader of Western Desert.</p>
<p>“Fang Yuan is number one in Gu refinement, but how can he be Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s match in terms of methods?” Zhou Xiong Xin laughed inwardly.</p>
<p>The very day, Wan Gu Chou announced the establishment of the new anti- Fang alliance.</p>
<p>With the revival of this strongest expert of Wan clan, the situation of the whole Western Desert Gu Immortal world changed suddenly.</p>
<p>Almost all the Gu Immortals of the five regions were paying close attention to it.</p>
<p>“This contest ended in Heavenly Court’s victory.”</p>
<p>“Fang clan is in danger!”</p>
<p>“I did not expect Heavenly Court to be able to revive other Gu Immortals and not just their own Heavenly Court members.”</p>
<p>“The big picture is still under the control of the venerables.”</p>
<p>“If Fang Yuan were to make a move, this Wan Gu Chou will only be a minor joke!”</p>
<p>“Hmph, Fang Yuan can make a move, but can’t Star Constellation Immortal Venerable do the same?”</p>
<p>“Haha, it’s best if the two venerables fight, then Ancestor Giant Sun can reap the benefits of their conflict.”</p>
