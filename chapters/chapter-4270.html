    <h1>Chapter 2265</h1>
    <p>: Grotto-Heaven’s Calamity</p>
<p>Hundreds of stars shot down at Profound Literature grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu’s subordinates had already heard the news, they waited in vigilance.</p>
<p>“They’re back!”</p>
<p>“Quickly activate the immortal formation!!”</p>
<p>Bam bam bam…</p>
<p>The stars landed on the immortal formation and erupted with immense power.</p>
<p>Profound light flashed as the stars broke into countless fragments.</p>
<p>The immortal formation suffered the heavy impact, the Gu Immortals coughed out blood from injuries.</p>
<p>A moment later, the tattered immortal formation still remained, while several stars continued to attack.</p>
<p>“Retreat.” Old Immortal Hua Yu ordered.</p>
<p>“Lord?!”</p>
<p>“But the grotto-heaven is right behind us.”</p>
<p>“If anything happens…”</p>
<p>“I refuse to retreat! Even if I have to give up my life, I will defend our home!”</p>
<p>Even though the Gu Immortals were currently weakened, their morale was very high.</p>
<p>Profound Literature grotto-heaven was originally condensed into a small dot in empty space, no matter how the stars flew outside, it was unaffected. But with the fusion of two heavens, an intense change occurred.</p>
<p>All of the two heavens’ grotto-heavens that were hidden were forced to reveal themselves.</p>
<p>Currently, behind the half-broken immortal formation was Profound Literature grotto-heaven’s entrance.</p>
<p>Even though the entrance was shut, it was exposed and could not be hidden.</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu shouted: “I have my ways, don’t hesitate, otherwise, you will lose your lives in vain!”</p>
<p>The immortals went silent, they quickly dismantled the immortal formation and escaped into Profound Literature grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>They all believed in Old Immortal Hua Yu.</p>
<p>“Here they come.” Old Immortal Hua Yu was alone as he watched the approaching stars, his expression was grim.</p>
<p>Immortal killer move — Cold Words!</p>
<p>Immortal killer move — Shattered Words!</p>
<p>The first move created frost that slowed down the stars. The second move slashed at the stars and shattered them into pieces.</p>
<p>However, large star fragments still continued to fly towards him with the remaining force.</p>
<p>“I’ll risk it!” Old Immortal Hua Yu shouted loudly, he disregarded his own life and used methods without stopping, eventually blocking all of the star fragments.</p>
<p>Guh.</p>
<p>He spat out a mouthful of blood, his expression was pale and wounds were all over his body, shining in star path light.</p>
<p>With the fusion of two heavens, the flying trajectory of the stars was affected by the Heavenly Dao and became chaotic, they were also amplified and became more powerful.</p>
<p>Even the rank eight Old Immortal Hua Yu had great difficulty in blocking them.</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu was about to return when he suddenly turned around, seeing another group of stars flying towards him.</p>
<p>If these stars really hit, Profound Literature grotto-heaven would not be able to take the impact!</p>
<p>His pupils contracted rapidly and his expression froze, but soon, he relaxed.</p>
<p>He was resolved for this.</p>
<p>Even if he had to sacrifice his life, he had to block them!</p>
<p>But at this time, Jun Shen Guang suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>Heavenly veil!</p>
<p>He flew while tossing with his hands, he quickly arrived in front of the stars and set up the heavenly veil.</p>
<p>Once the stars landed on the heavenly veil, it started shaking intensely, clear ripples could be seen on it.</p>
<p>“Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortal, Jun Shen Guang!” Old Immortal Hua Yu’s expression froze for a second.</p>
<p>“Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance’s Old Immortal Hua Yu!” Jun Shen Guang was slightly stunned and soon felt worried. It was currently the</p>
<p>crucial period, if Old Immortal Hua Yu took action, the heavenly veil would get destroyed again.</p>
<p>But Jun Shen Guang’s worries did not end up happening.</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes passed, Old Immortal Hua Yu still watched from the side and did not act. Jun Shen Guang collected the heavenly veil and collected all of the stars successfully.</p>
<p>Finally, Jun Shen Guang cast a deep gaze at Old Immortal Hua Yu, before dragging the huge heavenly veil bag and leaving with the stars.</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu had a complex expression as he opened the immortal aperture’s entrance and entered the grotto-heaven.</p>
<p>He was actually saved by Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire Profound Literature grotto-heaven, calamities struck everywhere, there were earthquakes and floods, volcanic eruptions caused huge areas of thick smoke in the sky, and acid rain had also been pouring for more than ten days.</p>
<p>“With the fusion of two heavens, the Heavenly Dao is stirred. Heaven’s will is chaotic, and all of our grotto-heavens that are situated on the heaven vein node are suffering.”</p>
<p>“Lifeforms have perished, living beings are anguished!”</p>
<p>“Sigh, I am guilty…”</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu sighed deeply, he was filled with guilt, helplessness, anger, sadness, and other complex emotions.</p>
<p>The Gu Immortals of the two heavens’ grotto-heavens had deep feelings for their own grotto-heaven world. This was different from the Gu Immortals of the five regions.</p>
<p>Gu Immortals of the two heavens’ grotto-heavens were ostracized by the five regions, they had to survive in this dangerous place.</p>
<p>Most of them were secluded cultivators, their grotto-heavens were the final and most important homeland where they could experience peace and comfort.</p>
<p>Among these grotto-heavens, Profound Literature grotto-heaven established a dynasty ruled by a single Gu Immortal force, it had deep literary development and the citizens saw this homeland as the most precious thing.</p>
<p>The immortals quickly came to greet Old Immortal Hua Yu.</p>
<p>“This was too dangerous. We should get help from the Heaven and Earth Great Love Alliance again!”</p>
<p>“With the fusion of two heavens, the environment has gotten incredibly dangerous. Those Eastern Sea Gu Immortals live in peace and tranquility, why would they come here and do such a risky thing?”</p>
<p>“Sigh, it is possible to get their help. But the price to pay is too high.”</p>
<p>“The entire Imperial Court’s foundation is running dry!”</p>
<p>“Skeleton grotto-heaven and others are also asking for help without caring about expenses. This creates a negative effect where Eastern Sea’s Gu Immortals demand higher prices in response. Damn it!”</p>
<p>“Sigh, Lord Alliance Leader is not even taking control of this!”</p>
<p>“Great Love Immortal Venerable is busy refining dao marks or making arrangements in Western Desert. Why would he care about the affairs of our small Profound Literature grotto-heaven?”</p>
<p>“In any case, our Profound Literature grotto-heaven will get annexed by him eventually!”</p>
<p>Old Immortal Hua Yu’s expression turned solemn as he scolded: “Everyone, shut up, don’t talk about Lord Alliance Leader in such a manner!”</p>
<p>Even though he said that, Old Immortal Hua Yu had a thought flash in his mind, he recalled the deep gaze that Jun Shen Guang showed earlier.</p>
<p>Longevity Heaven.</p>
<p>Golden light rippled constantly in waves.</p>
<p>“Hold on, hold on!” Several Gu Immortals among the Eight Extremities were controlling Calamity Luck Altar as they tried to stabilize the situation.</p>
<p>The entire Longevity Heaven was shaking intensely.</p>
<p>The earth shook.</p>
<p>Not just Calamity Luck Altar, Bing Sai Chuan was also controlling Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace.</p>
<p>However, both luck path Immortal Gu Houses were only barely able to keep the current situation stable.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>With a loud sound, the ground cracked and also broke the entire Longevity Heaven into two.</p>
<p>Swoosh swoosh.</p>
<p>Waves surged from below, scarlet red light soared up into the sky.</p>
<p>A vast sea of blood appeared in front of the immortals.</p>
<p>“Longevity Heaven has such a huge Blood Sea?” Bing Sai Chuan and the rest were shaken.</p>
<p>Heavenly Court.</p>
<p>The bright and peaceful atmosphere was no more.</p>
<p>Qin Ding Ling, Red Heart Traveler, Nine Spiritual Fairy, Prince Feng Xian, and other members were moving around everywhere.</p>
<p>Shabi Ninety-five, Ruan Dan, and even Qing Chou were mobilized to stabilize this situation.</p>
<p>Both the sky and earth were forming terrifying cracks.</p>
<p>The grand palaces had already been dismantled by Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals, they were condensed into ten or more rank six, seven, and eight Immortal Gu Houses.</p>
<p>No matter what the situation was, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable did not pay any attention to it, she focused entirely on refining Heavenly Court’s wisdom path dao marks.</p>
<p>Inside the sovereign immortal aperture.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan’s soul was lying in the pool water, feeling extremely relaxed.</p>
<p>The water was hot and steam was coming out of it, forming a region of white smoke.</p>
<p>Once in a while, there would be ripples in the water that splattered on Fang Yuan’s soul.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan’s soul originally had hundreds of arms and two heads, after the cleansing of the pool water, hundreds of arms had vanished, he also returned to having one head.</p>
<p>This was not an ordinary pool, it was Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool!</p>
<p>After Fang Yuan raised advance refinement Immortal Gu to rank nine, he started modifying Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool. Some time ago, he started to refine his soul in it.</p>
<p>Because the rank nine advance refinement Immortal Gu was added, Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool became a genuine rank nine Immortal Gu House.</p>
<p>This Immortal Gu House still had the same four cores, Advance Refinement, Water Refinement, Regret, and Blood Asset.</p>
<p>Advance Refinement was rank nine, the other three were rank eight.</p>
<p>Among which, blood asset Immortal Gu had reached its limit, it could not be raised to rank nine. Heavenly Court’s suppression of blood path’s development was showing great effect here.</p>
<p>Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool was created before the battle in Crazed Demon Cave, after advance refinement Immortal Gu became rank nine, Fang Yuan could modify it now that he was a refinement path supreme grandmaster.</p>
<p>Right now, Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool had undoubtedly gained a huge boost in power in terms of refining Gu!</p>
<p>Fang Yuan’s soul used Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool to cleanse itself, the effect was incredible.</p>
<p>The drawback of cultivating soul path was gradually weakening.</p>
<p>Fang Yuan’s soul path cultivation mainly relied on Spectral Soul’s soul path true inheritance. This true inheritance had a huge drawback, it was completely exposed now!</p>
<p>Humans could reach hundred million man soul at most, that was their racial limit.</p>
<p>But after Red Lotus Demon Venerable damaged fate Gu, and with Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s innovation, he broke the limit of the human soul and created a qualitative change, he allowed hundred million man soul to reach desolate soul. After that, it could continue to grow to ten desolate soul, hundred desolate soul… all the way to hundred million desolate soul.</p>
<p>Hundred million desolate soul was the end point of Spectral Soul’s true inheritance, it could create the Three Headed Thousand Arms Demon Soul which possessed quasi-rank nine battle strength. The soul could directly</p>
<p>resist calamities and tribulations, defy the heavens and stomp the earth, slaughter deities and ghosts, and shock the world with unmatched might!</p>
<p>This was the peak of soul cultivation, it was the upper limit that this world could allow.</p>
<p>But Fang Yuan gradually found that this cultivation method had a huge drawback, because Spectral Soul Demon Venerable overly pursued strength, many threats were left behind.</p>
<p>A human soul was a human soul, after becoming a desolate soul, the pure human nature would gain beast nature, or more accurately speaking, heaven nature!</p>
<p>Hundred million desolate soul was truly terrifying, but the proportion of human nature also became very low, the bestial traits took over most of its nature.</p>
<p>At this current moment, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable lost his senses and got controlled by Star Constellation Immortal Venerable. Afterwards, he roamed the two heavens and acted according to his beast nature, this was the most obvious flaw!</p>
<p>Fang Yuan had some estimations towards Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s current condition.</p>
<p>Some time ago, Shen Shang contributed his human path cultivation results, Fang Yuan compared the two and confirmed the drawback of soul path cultivation.</p>
<p>“In the past, human path was not developed, thus, the limit of a human was hundred million man soul. Spectral Soul Demon Venerable had to break through it forcefully, but truthfully, he had gone in the wrong direction.”</p>
<p>“Of course, there are many reasons for this.”</p>
<p>“Back then, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable wanted to create killing path, he devoured the black heaven heavenly spirit but failed to succeed, causing</p>
<p>him to create soul path instead. There is a huge secret behind this, the more I think about this, the scarier it is!”</p>
