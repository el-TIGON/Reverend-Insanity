        <p>:  Star  Constellation,  I  Will  Need  You  To  Die</p>
<p>If  not  for  Heavenly  Court  revealing  it,  the  world  would  still  be  unaware  of   Lin  Jian  Xing  possessing  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength.  He  hid  it  so  well   that  he  definitely  had  other  motives.</p>
<p>And  looking  at  the  reaction  of  most  of  the  Lin  clan  Gu  Immortals,  they   were  also  unaware  of  this.</p>
<p>Western  Desert’s  righteous  path  super  forces  were  adopting  a  wait  and  see   attitude.</p>
<p>Many  of  them  anticipated  Lin  Jian  Xing  to  give  an  explanation  but  Lin  clan   remained  silent  and  gave  no  such  thing.</p>
<p>There  was  no  movement  in  Western  Desert’s  righteous  path.</p>
<p>They  did  not  want  to  create  an  anti-Lin  alliance  after  the  anti-Fang  alliance.</p>
<p>The  consequences  of  attacking  Fang  clan  was  already  before  them.  If  Lin   clan  were  to  imitate  Fang  clan  as  well,  with  a  pseudo  venerable  bringing  the   whole  clan  to  fight  a  guerrilla  war,  how  Western  Desert’s  righteous  path   possibly  survive?</p>
<p>“It  is  impossible  for  Fang  clan  to  make  a  move.  Seems  like  the  previous   series  of  Fang  clan’s  attacks  was  a  deception  created  by  Heavenly  Court.”  It   was  clear  to  Fang  Yuan  after  he  read  through  the  whole  information.</p>
<p>After  Fang  clan  lost  all  their  resource  points,  they  had  to  rely  on  Fang  Yuan   even  more.  So,  Fang  Yuan  had  an  even  deeper  control  over  them.  If  Fang   clan  were  to  attack  at  such  a  large  scale,  it  was  impossible  for  them  to  not   notify  him  and  ask  for  his  instructions.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  found  it  somewhat  funny.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court  tried  to  put  their  hands  in  Western  Desert,  it  would  have   been  okay  if  they  chose  anyone  else,  but  they  just  happened  to  choose  the   strongest  target!</p>
<p>But  shortly  after,  Fang  Yuan  fell  into  deep  thought.</p>
<p>He  thought  of  an  issue:  ”Why  did  Heavenly  Court  suddenly  target  Lin   clan?”</p>
<p>Was  it  because  they  discovered  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder’s  pseudo   venerable  strength  and  wanted  to  get  rid  of  him  in  advance  for  their  plan  to   conquest  the  five  regions?</p>
<p>This  possibility  was  too  low.</p>
<p>Not  to  mention  that  the  greatest  obstacle  to  Heavenly  Court  ruling  the  five   regions  were  the  other  venerables,  pseudo  venerables  were  inconsequential.</p>
<p>Also,  even  if  Heavenly  Court  discovered  that  Lin  clan’s  first  supreme  elder   had  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength,  why  would  they  only  send  five   Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  to  kill  him?</p>
<p>This  was  clearly  not  reasonable.</p>
<p>“What  is  Heavenly  Court’s  true  motive?  Why  did  they  suddenly  target  Lin   clan?”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  knew  from  Fang  clan  that  Lin  clan  had  never  colluded  with  Fang   clan.</p>
<p>This  was  just  Heavenly  Court  framing  them!</p>
<p>“Is  it  because  Lin  Jian  Xing  is  an  otherworldly  demon?”</p>
<p>That  was  not  right  either.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  stance  towards  otherworldly  demons  was  not  radical   extermination.</p>
<p>If  they  could  be  recruited,  Heavenly  Court  would  recruit  them.  They  had   tried  to  recruit  Fang  Yuan  as  well.</p>
<p>Heavenly  Court’s  recruitment  standard  was  very  clear—they  just  needed  to   be  humans!</p>
<p>“So  what  was  the  reason?  As  the  number  one  person  in  wisdom  path,  even   if  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  make  the  plan,  she  must   have  agreed  to  attacking  Lin  clan.  But  she  rarely  miscalculates,  so  what  was   it  that  made  her  agree  to  attacking  Lin  clan?”</p>
<p>This  question  was  crucial  and  was  worth  pondering  over.</p>
<p>Even  though  wisdom  Gu  was  only  at  rank  eight,  it  was  helpful  to  Fang   Yuan.</p>
<p>After  he  used  all  kinds  of  wisdom  path  methods,  Fang  Yuan  had  some   guesses  but  he  was  not  certain.</p>
<p>After  all,  they  were  only  deductions.</p>
<p>What  was  the  truth?</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  naturally  had  a  way  to  verify  his  deductions.</p>
<p>He  immediately  sent  an  order  to  make  a  rank  five  Gu  Master  undergo   immortal  ascension.</p>
<p>Currently,  there  was  no  such  rank  five  Gu  Immortal  seed  in  sovereign   immortal  aperture.  Moreover,  these  Gu  Immortal  seeds  did  not  have  deep</p>
<p>foundation  or  enough  experience,  the  possibility  of  them  succeeding  in   immortal  ascension  was  very  low.  This  was  why  Fang  Yuan  decided  to  stop   them  to  let  them  continue  to  deepen  their  foundation.</p>
<p>But  because  this  issue  was  very  important,  Fang  Yuan  felt  it  was  worth   expending  a  rank  five  Gu  Master.</p>
<p>In  the  end,  this  rank  five  Gu  Master  failed  and  died  from  the  imbalance  of   three  qi.</p>
<p>But  using  the  short  period  of  time  of  merging  the  three  qi,  Fang  Yuan  used   stealing  heavenly  secret  to  explore  the  truth.</p>
<p>Although  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  was  outside  of  Heavenly   Court,  being  in  Embroidered  Tower,  when  she  gave  order  to  attack  Lin  clan,   Bo  Qing’s  soul  was  taken  out  from  Heavenly  Court’s  secret  storage.</p>
<p>This  was  obvious  evidence!</p>
<p>Adding  on  that  Fairy  Maiden  Soul  modified  Bo  Qing’s  soul  in  Heavenly   Court,  Fang  Yuan  learned  of  many  valuable  information.</p>
<p>“Fairy  Zi  Wei  and  Ying  Wu  Xie  are  trapped  in  heaven  path  dream  realms,   so  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  decided  to  cultivate  Bo  Qing  even   though  this  action  carries  risks.”</p>
<p>With  these  clues,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  goal  was   obvious,  it  was  to  use  Bo  Qing  to  scheme  against  Spectral  Soul  Demon   Venerable.</p>
<p>“Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable…”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  eyes  shone  darkly  as  he  mumbled.</p>
<p>He  knew  why  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  wanted  to  deal  with   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s  actions   already  made  him  the  main  threat  to  Heavenly  Court.</p>
<p>Naturally,  this  was  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  understanding   under  the  condition  of  Fang  Yuan  hiding  his  situation.</p>
<p>Were  the  truth  of  Fang  Yuan’s  many  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  to  be  revealed,   Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  would  be  thrown  aside,  not  only  would   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  find  trouble  with  Fang  Yuan,  Giant   Sun  Immortal  Venerable  would  also  impatiently  ally  with  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  to  attack  Fang  Yuan!</p>
<p>Splash  splash  splash.</p>
<p>At  this  time,  Fang  Yuan  made  deductions  rapidly,  thoughts  gushed  in  his   mind  and  formed  into  torrential  waves.</p>
<p>He  knew  an  opportunity  was  before  him.</p>
<p>A  huge  opportunity!</p>
<p>If  he  missed  this  chance,  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  might   succeed  in  her  plan.</p>
<p>Such  opportunities  seldom  came  twice.</p>
<p>So  would  he  be  able  to  grasp  this  opportunity?</p>
<p>If  he  could  not,  the  outcome  would  be  extremely  bad  to  Fang  Yuan.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  could  not  decide  immediately.</p>
<p>Although  he  knew  of  heavenly  court’s  secret,  he  did  not  know  how  much   progress  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  had  made  over  this  period   of  time.</p>
<p>He  was  even  more  in  the  dark  regarding  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  and   Longevity  Heaven.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  refined  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,  he  had  an  advantage  in  this   aspect.  But  the  other  venerables  might  be  able  to  offset  his  refinement  path   advantage  through  other  aspects.</p>
<p>Battle.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  like  battles,  but  he  did  not  hate  or  reject  them.</p>
<p>As  far  as  he  was  concerned,  battles  and  killing  were  only  a  way  to  obtain   benefits.</p>
<p>An  outcome  of  inflicting  a  little  more  damage  to  enemy  while  suffering  less   damage  was  already  a  good  result  in  a  battle.</p>
<p>There  were  huge  risks  in  battle.</p>
<p>It  was  not  a  wise  decision  to  start  a  fight  rashly.</p>
<p>Compared  to  fighting,  Fang  Yuan  liked  doing  transactions  —  to  plunder  the   economy.</p>
<p>But  Fang  Yuan  was  aware:  There  will  be  upcoming  battles  between  the   venerables  and  it  will  be  frequent!</p>
<p>“Lets  fight  then.”  After  pondering  and  considering  for  several  days,  Fang   Yuan  finally  made  this  decision.</p>
<p>And  he  immediately  took  action.</p>
<p>On  one  hand,  he  sent  Gu  Immortals  to  Western  Desert  to  contact  Lin  Jian   Xing  and  try  to  recruit  him;  on  the  other  hand,  he  arranged  a  troop  of   capable  experts.</p>
<p>After  making  proper  arrangements,  Fang  Yuan  flew  to  the  sky  and  entered   spectral  heaven!</p>
<p>Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable  suddenly  flew  into  spectral  heaven—this   significant  information  was  quickly  obtained  by  Heavenly  Court  and   Longevity  Heaven,  it  was  rapidly  spread  throughout  the  whole  five  regions’   Gu  Immortal  world.</p>
<p>Every  action  of  a  venerable  captured  the  attention  of  all  the  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Let  alone  when  Fang  Yuan  was  making  such  a  big  movement!</p>
<p>“What  is  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  trying  to  do  by  entering   spectral  heaven?  Fight  with  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable?”  Giant  Sun   Immortal  Venerable  was  puzzled.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  however,  felt  her  heart  jump.</p>
<p>Not  long  ago,  she  had  completed  the  transaction  with  Fang  Yuan  regarding   the  star  array  calculation  formation.  Her  calculations  went  wrong  because   of  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  strength  and  she  was  just  about  to  deal  with  this  when   Fang  Yuan  made  such  a  strange  movement.</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  even  make  a  deduction  when   a  strong  intuition  hit  her—this  was  going  to  be  bad!</p>
<p>But  as  the  exact  situation  and  how  this  intuition  was  going  to  be  realized,   Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  did  not  know.  She  needed  to   continue  deducing  or  let  the  situation  play  out.</p>
<p>“Among  the  venerables,  Fang  Yuan  is  the  person  in  the  worst  position.  Why   did  he  take  the  initiative  to  go  to  spectral  heaven?”  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  was  also  puzzled.</p>
<p>Spectral  heaven  had  already  become  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable’s   territory,  he  did  not  show  any  movements  when  other  Gu  Immortals  entered   or  left  spectral  heaven.</p>
<p>But  if  a  venerable  like  Fang  Yuan  entered?</p>
<p>This  was  like  a  tiger  occupying  a  mountain,  it  would  not  move  when  some   small  animals  stepped  onto  the  mountain.  But  if  another  tiger  entered  the   mountain,  the  tiger  would  become  vigilant  and  even  start  a  fight.</p>
<p>Would  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  attack  Fang  Yuan?</p>
<p>The  reply  to  this  issue  weighed  on  the  two  venerables’  minds.</p>
<p>They  activated  their  investigative  killer  moves  to  pay  close  attention— Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable  did  not  show  any  movement!</p>
<p>Both  venerables  were  shaken.</p>
<p>Both  thought  of  a  possibility  at  the  same  time:  Did  Fang  Yuan  have  a   method  against  Spectral  Soul  Demon  Venerable,  so  he  had  the  confidence   to  enter  spectral  heaven?</p>
<p>But  why  did  he  suddenly  enter  spectral  heaven?</p>
<p>Similar  question  appeared  before  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   and  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable’s  first  thought  was:  ”Has  Fang  Yuan  already   settled  the  issues  inside  sovereign  immortal  aperture  and  is  trying  to  annex   variant  human  grotto-heavens?”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable’s  heart  jolted  as  the  bad  feeling  grew   in  her  heart:  ”Does  Fang  Yuan  already  know  of  the  heaven  path  dream   realms?  In  the  battle  in  Crazed  Demon  Cave,  he  killed  Paradise  Earth  and   obtained  a  large  piece  of  truthful  floating  ice  left  after  Limitless  Demon   Venerable’s  death….”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  did  not  conceal  his  movement  and  directly  went  towards  the   location  of  heaven  path  dream  realms  after  he  entered  spectral  heaven.</p>
<p>Soon,  he  was  before  the  heaven  path  dream  realms.</p>
<p>After  sensing  this,  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  was  shaken:  ”This  is  a   dream  realm?  It  is  the  dream  realm  closest  to  the  depiction  in  <<The   Legends  of  Ren  Zu>>!  So  Fang  Yuan’s  target  is  them.”</p>
<p>Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  frowned,  Fang  Yuan  had  heaven   path  cultivation  and  was  also  the  number  one  person  in  the  world  regarding   dream  path,  the  heaven  path  dream  realms  were  too  useful  to  him.</p>
<p>“I  can’t  let  Fang  Yuan  succeed!”  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   thought  of  this  and  immediately  contact  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable.</p>
<p>Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  learned  that  these  were  heaven  path  dream   realms.</p>
<p>He  immediately  agreed  to  ally  with  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable   to  suppress  Fang  Yuan  and  stop  him  from  obtaining  heaven  path  dream   realms.  At  the  same  time,  he  wondered  to  himself  if  this  was  real  or  not.</p>
<p>This  was  the  first  time  Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  knew  of  the  heaven   path  dream  realm’s  existence.</p>
<p>“I  already  have  a  rank  nine  Gu,  although  it  is  light  Gu,  is  damaged  and  can’t   be  used  for  the  moment,  this  is  already  enough  to  make  Star  Constellation   Immortal  Venerable  and  Heaven  Refining  Demon  Venerable  ally  to  deal   with  me.  So,  is  this  situation  planned  by  them  to  plot  against  me?”</p>
<p>This  was  definitely  a  possibility.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  looked  at  the  heaven  path  dream  realm  before  him  and  sent   dream  butterfly  Immortal  Gu  inside.</p>
<p>Dream  butterfly  Immortal  Gu  was  an  investigative  Gu,  Fang  Yuan  soon   learned  the  details  of  the  heaven  path  dream  realm.</p>
<p>He  became  quite  excited:  ”The  price  to  create  these  heaven  path  dream   realms  is  huge,  the  Heavenly  Dao  definitely  expended  its  true  meaning.   This  means,  if  I  obtain  these  dream  realms  and  absorb  the  true  meaning,  the   loss  of  the  Heavenly  Dao  will  become  my  gain.  Through  this,  my   attainment  in  some  aspects  of  heaven  path  can  become  even  higher  than  the   Heavenly  Dao!”</p>
<p>Naturally,  this  could  not  be  considered  as  heaven  path  supreme   grandmaster.</p>
<p>Because  right  now,  there  were  too  many  things  in  heaven  path  that  Fang   Yuan  still  could  not  comprehend.</p>
<p>“Fang  Yuan,  have  you  been  well?”  Just  as  he  was  thinking,  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  arrived.</p>
<p>“As  expected,  it  is  easy  to  do  things  secretly,  but  hard  to  do  them  openly.   Giant  Sun  Immortal  Venerable  is  probably  arriving  as  well.”  Fang  Yuan   thought  of  this  and  smiled  at  Star  Constellation  Immortal  Venerable,  ”Star   Constellation,  I  must  have  these  dream  realms!  If  you  don’t  retreat,  I  will   need  you  to  die.”</p>
