    <p>:  Yet  Another  Rank  Nine  Immortal</p>
<p>Gu</p>
<p>Inside  the  sovereign  immortal  aperture.</p>
<p>Mini  Eastern  Sea.</p>
<p>Refinement  Sea’s  sea  area.</p>
<p>Sea  breeze  blew  and  sound  of  the  waves  could  be  heard  constantly.</p>
<p>An  elderly  rank  five  hairy  man  was  lying  on  a  dinghy  in  an  unconscious   state.</p>
<p>The  dinghy  moved  along  with  the  waves,  if  no  changes  occurred,  this   elderly  hairy  man  was  going  to  face  death  by  drowning.</p>
<p>But  a  towered  ship  was  moving  past  here,  and  the  people  on  the  ship  started   shouting  when  they  noticed  the  dingy.</p>
<p>When  the  elderly  hairy  man  woke  up,  he  found  he  was  already  on  the   towered  ship.</p>
<p>“Elder,  are  you  also  going  to  the  refinement  path  sacred  land  to  compete  for   the  qualifications  to  enter  Floating  Refinement  Hive?”  A  hairy  man  Gu   Master  on  the  ship  asked.</p>
<p>The  elder  nodded:  ”I  live  in  Mini  Northern  Plains,  I  heard  about  Floating   Refinement  Hive  and  learned  that  it  was  forged  by  the  orders  of  our   Supreme  Lord  Great  Love  Immortal  Venerable.  This  refinement  path  sacred   land  might  be  my  final  hope  to  make  a  breakthrough.”</p>
<p>The  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  on  the  ship  exclaimed  in  surprise:  ”Senior,  it  is   really  not  easy  for  you  to  make  such  a  long  trip  from  Mini  Northern  Plains   to  here,  you  have  our  respect!”</p>
<p>The  elderly  hairy  man  shook  his  head,  smiling  bitterly:  ”At  first,  it  was  not   just  me,  there  were  three  others  as  well.  But  on  the  dangerous  journey,  two   died  in  succession,  while  the  remaining  one  did  not  dare  to  continue  and   returned.  So,  only  I  arrived  here.”</p>
<p>Sovereign  immortal  aperture  was  not  safe.</p>
<p>Especially  when  abnormal  situations  occurred  frequently,  the  stable  living   habitats  were  the  areas  where  clans  or  large  groups  settled;  those  areas  were   usually  protected  by  immortal  formations  or  Gu  Immortals.</p>
<p>Even  rank  five  Gu  Masters  would  have  to  face  huge  risks  if  they  were  to   make  a  long  journey.</p>
<p>The  elderly  hairy  man  also  asked  about  the  origins  of  the  hairy  man  Gu   Masters  on  the  ship.</p>
<p>Like  what  he  had  expected,  these  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  came  from  Mini   Eastern  Sea’s  three  hairy  man  continents.</p>
<p>Back  then,  Lang  Ya  blessed  land’s  Yellow  Hair  Continent,  Black  Hair   Continent,  and  White  Hair  Continent  were  jointly  called  three  hairy  man   continents.</p>
<p>These  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  had  different  cultivation  levels;  rank  four  were   the  majority,  there  were  few  rank  fives,  and  there  were  also  rank  threes  but   they  were  rare.</p>
<p>“I  am  really  envious  of  you,  you  all  live  so  close  to  the  refinement  path   sacred  land!”  The  elderly  hairy  man  let  out  his  inner  sigh.</p>
<p>“What’s  the  point  of  being  close?  We  are  forbidden  from  entering  during   normal  times.”</p>
<p>“How  can  we  be  allowed  to  enter  the  sacred  land  so  casually?”</p>
<p>“From  what  I  know,  many  Gu  Immortals’  descendants  can  enter  casually.   Sigh,  we  can’t  compare  to  them.  They  have  Gu  Immortal  seniors,  they  enter   or  leave  this  area  through  flying  boats  which  are  extremely  fast!”</p>
<p>“As  long  as  this  test  is  not  difficult  and  I  pass  it,  I  will  have  the   qualifications  to  enter  and  leave  here  freely.”</p>
<p>The  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  discussed.</p>
<p>Several  days  later,  the  elderly  hairy  man  and  the  hairy  man  Gu  Masters   arrived  above  a  Floating  Refinement  Hive.</p>
<p>The  Floating  Refinement  Hive  was  enormous  and  towering,  making  all  the   Gu  Masters  exclaim  in  shock.</p>
<p>A  voice  entered  every  person’s  ears,  instructing  the  correct  path  to  enter  the   Floating  Refinement  Hive.</p>
<p>The  Floating  Refinement  Hive’s  structure  was  even  more  complex,  there   were  countless  rooms  and  corridors  which  made  it  easy  to  get  lost.</p>
<p>With  the  guidance  of  that  voice,  the  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  found  their   rooms  one  after  the  other.</p>
<p>There  were  all  kinds  of  living  amenities  in  the  rooms  but  they  were   extremely  simple,  clearly  showing  the  style  of  asceticism.</p>
<p>That  night,  the  newly  arrived  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  slept  well.</p>
<p>The  second  day  began,  Gu  materials  were  sent  to  the  separate  Gu   refinement  chamber  in  the  room.</p>
<p>The  hairy  man  Gu  Masters  began  their  Gu  refinement.</p>
<p>According  to  the  explanation  of  that  mysterious  voice,  this  was  the  initial   test;  the  Gu  Masters  were  required  to  use  their  most  proficient  methods  to   process  Gu  materials  or  refine  Gu  worms.</p>
<p>This  test  lasted  for  three  days  in  which  time  Gu  Masters  could  display  their   attainment  to  their  heart’s  content.</p>
<p>After  the  test,  Gu  Masters  would  be  shifted  to  different  rooms;  some  moved   to  higher  floors  while  some  were  dropped  to  lower  floors.</p>
<p>Floating  Refinement  Hive  did  not  restrict  interaction  between  Gu  Masters,   all  kinds  of  small-scale  meetings  were  held  during  night  frequently.</p>
<p>The  rank  five  elderly  hairy  man  Gu  Master  saw  many  excellent  Gu  Master.   Among  them,  hairy  men  were  the  most  numerous,  but  there  were  also   humans,  and  even  some  other  variant  human  Gu  Masters.</p>
<p>He  also  heard  many  news.  One  day,  according  to  everyone’s  speculation,   they  concluded  that  the  Gu  Masters  on  higher  floors  had  better  results.</p>
<p>Because  the  higher  the  floor,  the  better  the  environment  of  the  room,  and   the  more  exquisite  the  food  served.</p>
<p>Gu  Masters  began  to  compete  intensely  based  on  this  standard.</p>
<p>Floating  Refinement  Hive  never  lacked  tasks  to  process  Gu  materials,  refine   Gu  worms,  or  create  new  Gu.</p>
<p>If  the  Gu  Masters  passed  with  good  results,  they  could  request  guidance   from  the  mysterious  voice,  learning  exquisite  Gu  refinement  knowledge  and   techniques.</p>
<p>After  living  here  for  a  couple  of  weeks,  all  the  Gu  Masters  felt  their  strength   rising  rapidly.</p>
<p>Like  this,  fourteen  days  passed  and  the  Gu  Masters  faced  the  mid-term  test.</p>
<p>A  top  tier  Gu  material  needed  to  be  processed  by  many  Gu  Masters   together.</p>
<p>The  Gu  Masters  were  distributed  in  their  respective  rooms,  they  watched   the  real-time  video  and  processed  the  material  together  at  separate   locations.  The  video  was  lifelike  and  even  had  vivid  temperature  and  smell   like  it  truly  existed.  The  real  Gu  materials  were  in  a  refinement  path  Gu   formation  in  a  secret  area  and  were  not  placed  before  the  Gu  Masters.</p>
<p>Such  a  method  was  unimaginable,  shocking  and  awing  the  Gu  Masters.</p>
<p>The  mid-term  test  soon  ended.  Ten  or  so  days  passed  again  before  it  was   time  for  the  final  test.</p>
<p>This  time,  the  test  was  to  process  immortal  materials.</p>
<p>Naturally,  the  main  lead  were  Gu  Immortals,  every  Floating  Refinement   Hive  had  at  least  one  refinement  path  Gu  Immortal.  The  Gu  Masters  were   in  charge  of  doing  some  supplementary  tasks  like  processing  a  part  of  the   immortal  material,  and  so  on.</p>
<p>After  passing  the  final  test,  the  Gu  Masters  possessed  the  qualifications  to   enter  and  leave  Refinement  Sea  freely.</p>
<p>But  this  qualification  had  a  time  limit  of  fifty  years.  Once  this  time  limit   was  up,  they  had  to  retake  the  test.</p>
<p>Most  of  Fang  Yuan’s  Floating  Refinement  Hives  were  packed  with  Gu   Masters.</p>
<p>The  earlier  stage  did  not  have  a  high  standard,  most  of  the  Gu  Masters   could  pass  and  obtain  this  qualification.</p>
<p>But  in  the  future,  as  the  population  increases  explosively,  there  would  be   intense  competition  in  every  field.  This  was  even  more  so  for  the   qualification  to  enter  Refinement  Sea.</p>
<p>Every  Floating  Refinement  Hive  could  borrow  the  help  of  Refinement  Sea   and  greatly  raise  the  success  rate  of  Gu  refinement.  At  the  same  time,  the</p>
<p>wasted  Gu  materials  from  refining  in  these  refinement  hives  were  melted  by   the  Floating  Refinement  Hives  and  sent  to  Refinement  Sea.</p>
<p>Both  components  complemented  each  other.</p>
<p>If  there  was  no  replenishment  from  the  Floating  Refinement  Hives,  the   current  Refinement  Sea’s  water  level  would  have  already  fallen  by  a  lot.</p>
<p>After  all,  Fang  Yuan  had  been  trying  to  advance  an  Immortal  Gu  for  many   days.</p>
<p>The  central  area  of  Refinement  Sea  was  an  absolute  forbidden  ground,  only   the  Gu  Immortals  permitted  by  Fang  Yuan  could  enter.</p>
<p>It  was  because  Four  Elements  Square  Regret  Blood  Refinement  Pool  was   there!</p>
<p>Suddenly,  a  rumbling  sound  spread  from  Four  Elements  Square  Regret   Blood  Refinement  Pool,  a  light  pillar  suddenly  took  shape  and  soared   towards  the  sky.</p>
<p>The  light  pillar  slowly  dissipated  and  a  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu  revealed   itself.</p>
<p>This  heaven  path  Immortal  Gu  looked  like  a  crystal  spider,  it  was  clear  and   transparent  with  no  flaws  on  the  body.  The  spider’s  eight  legs  were  slim  and   long,  its  body  was  also  small  and  raised  high  by  the  eight  legs.</p>
<p>It  was  heavenly  web  Gu.</p>
<p>And  on  the  back  of  heavenly  web  Gu,  there  was  a  cobweb-like  white   insignia.</p>
<p>This  was  unique  to  rank  nine  heavenly  web  Gu,  rank  eight  heavenly  web   Gu  did  not  have  it.</p>
<p>“Success,  master  gained  yet  another  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu!”</p>
<p>“Goodness,  it  is  our  utmost  glory  to  be  able  to  participate  in  this  whole   process.”</p>
<p>“As  long  as  this  continues,  master  will  definitely  trample  on  all  the   venerables  one  day!!”</p>
<p>There  were  other  Gu  Immortals  who  took  part  in  the  advance  refinement   process  in  Four  Elements  Square  Regret  Blood  Refinement  Pool,  most  of   them  were  hairy  men.  They  looked  at  the  sky  and  sighed  with  emotions.</p>
<p>Under  the  control  of  Fang  Yuan’s  divine  sense,  rank  nine  heavenly  web  Gu   disappeared  shortly  after.</p>
<p>“Rank  nine  heavenly  web  Gu  is  also  refined.”</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan’s  mood  was  tranquil.</p>
<p>He  had  refined  several  rank  nine  Immortal  Gu,  he  was  becoming  used  to  it   and  did  not  feel  excitement.</p>
<p>Although  the  Gu  refinement  failed  twice,  there  was  no  setbacks  after  that   and  it  finished  smoothly.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  had  pondered  over  this  before  finally  choosing  to  advance   heavenly  web  Gu.</p>
<p>He  needed  an  Immortal  Gu  that  could  help  him  in  frontal  offense  and   defense.  And  among  the  two  main  aspects  of  offense  and  defense,  Fang   Yuan  unhesitatingly  chose  the  latter.</p>
<p>Because  of  non-conflicting  dao  marks  of  sovereign  immortal  body,  its   defense  was  extremely  weak  and  was  Fang  Yuan’s  shortcoming.</p>
<p>If  other  venerables  used  this  point,  Fang  Yuan  would  have  almost  no  place   in  a  frontal  combat  and  the  consequences  would  be  extremely  severe.</p>
<p>When  heavenly  web  Gu  was  activated  by  itself,  it  could  release  a  giant  web   to  trap  the  target.</p>
<p>Strictly  speaking,  it  was  not  a  defensive  Gu,  it  belonged  to  the  offensive   aspect.</p>
<p>But  it  was  the  core  of  a  defensive  killer  move  —Heavenly  Web  Protection   Veil.</p>
<p>Heavenly  web  protection  veil’s  power  increased  massively  and  was  even   stronger  than  reverse  flow  protection  seal  now.</p>
<p>Moreover,  heavenly  web  Gu  could  be  used  in  obscured  heavenly  secret,   increasing  the  power  of  this  move  as  well.</p>
<p>Fang  Yuan  chose  heaven  path  and  gave  up  on  refinement  path  because   refinement  path  did  not  specialize  in  offense;  moreover,  it  was  too  widely   spread.</p>
<p>Heaven  path  had  extremely  wide  future  prospects,  and  when  developed   well,  was  far  better  than  human  path.</p>
<p>Even  more  amazing  was  that  almost  no  one  had  the  qualifications  to   cultivate  heaven  path.</p>
<p>So,  it  was  extremely  wise  of  Fang  Yuan  to  choose  heaven  path  as  his   specialty.  Using  heaven  path  for  offensive  methods  was  naturally  the  best   choice.</p>
<p>Taking  back  the  rank  nine  heavenly  web  Gu,  Fang  Yuan  inspected  his   storage.</p>
<p>Because  of  two  failures,  a  lot  of  heaven  path  immortal  materials  were   expended.  As  for  the  secluded  domain  of  heaven  and  earth,  Refinement</p>
<p>Sea,  the  sea  level  did  fall  but  not  to  the  point  of  exceeding  the  limit,  it  could   self-recover  even  if  it  was  not  looked  after.</p>
<p>Naturally,  the  constant  resource  deposit  by  Floating  Refinement  Hives   accelerated  the  recovery  of  Refinement  Sea.</p>
<p>Just  as  Fang  Yuan  was  planning  on  which  rank  eight  Immortal  Gu  to   advance  next,  news  arrived.</p>
<p>Five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  surrounded  and  attacked  Lin  clan’s  first   supreme  elder  Lin  Jian  Xing  but  were  utterly  defeated.  Lin  Jian  Xing   revealed  pseudo  venerable  battle  strength,  he  colluded  with  Fang  clan  and   helped  to  hide  them,  sending  them  intel  secretly.  Moreover,  he  was  an   otherworldly  demon  himself!</p>
<p>There  was  much  evidence  pointing  to  the  fact  that  Lin  Jian  Xing  colluded   with  and  protected  Fang  clan,  it  could  be  said  to  be  ironclad.  As  an   information  path  great  expert,  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  not  only  had  the  ability  to   gather  clues,  he  also  had  the  ability  to  forge  false  evidence.</p>
<p>As  for  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  otherworldly  demon  identity,  it  was  deduced  by  Star   Constellation  Immortal  Venerable  personally.</p>
<p>The  whole  world  was  in  an  uproar,  Western  Desert  was  in  even  more  chaos.</p>
<p>It  was  not  easy  for  a  pseudo  venerable  to  emerge  in  this  region,  but  before   Western  Desert’s  righteous  path  could  feel  any  pride  about  this,  they  were   dumbfounded.</p>
<p>This  pseudo  venerable  Lin  Jian  Xing  was  actually  dabbling  in  the  demonic   path  and  his  involvement  was  quite  deep!</p>
