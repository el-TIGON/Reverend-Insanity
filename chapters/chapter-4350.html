        <p>:  Heavenly  Court’s  Crushing  Defeat</p>
<p>“How  do  we  deal  with  this?”</p>
<p>“Since  the  formation  is  already  broken,  we  can  only  rely  on  rumor  cage.”</p>
<p>“What  is  Lin  Jian  Xing  planning?”</p>
<p>“If  he  is  thinking  of  waiting  for  the  anti-Fang  alliance  or  Western  Desert   righteous  paths’  reinforcements,  he  will  be  disappointed.”</p>
<p>Wan  Zi  Hong,  Prince  Feng  Xian,  Zhou  Xiong  Xin,  Red  Heart  Traveler,  and   Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  followed  Lin  Jian  Xing  while  secretly  conversing.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  methods  were  exceptionally  exquisite,  ruining  the  five   immortals’  plan.</p>
<p>With  just  sword  qi  takes  form  killer  move,  he  fooled  them  for  so  long,   making  these  Heavenly  Court  immortals  feel  ashamed  of  themselves.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  main  body  used  that  time  to  destroy  Heavenly  Court’s   formation.</p>
<p>This  made  the  Heavenly  Court  immortals  realize  that  their  battle  plan  had  a   mistake,  they  should  have  designated  one  person  to  guard  the  formation.</p>
<p>In  fact,  the  formation  had  a  certain  amount  of  defensive  capability  and  also   had  the  ability  to  convey  messages.  If  it  was  attacked,  the  message  should   have  been  sent.  Even  if  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  were  inside   rumor  cage,  they  could  still  obtain  the  reminder.</p>
<p>Rumor  cage  battlefield  isolated  the  inside  and  outside,  the  ones  inside  could   not  even  connect  to  treasure  yellow  heaven.</p>
<p>But  this  message  would  directly  rush  to  rumor  cage,  creating  subtle   vibrations  in  rumor  cage  as  a  warning.</p>
<p>At  that  time,  the  five  immortals  would  know  that  the  formation  was  being   destroyed,  they  would  react  to  the  specific  situation  and  send  a  few  people   to  deal  with  it.</p>
<p>However,  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  methods  were  exceptional,  he  quietly  dismantled   the  whole  formation  without  alerting  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals.</p>
<p>However,  he  still  returned  the  obtained  Immortal  Gu  to  these  five  immortals   openly.</p>
<p>Such  magnanimity  captivated  even  these  Heavenly  Court  immortals.</p>
<p>Under  this  situation,  when  Lin  Jian  Xing  mentioned  changing  the   battlefield,  the  Heavenly  Court  immortals  were  too  ashamed  to  continue   fighting  in  Lin  clan’s  public  blessed  land  headquarters.</p>
<p>“This  is  the  place.”  Lin  Jian  Xing  slowly  stopped  in  the  air  and  turned   around  to  face  the  Heavenly  Court  immortals.</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  looked  around,  this  desert  was  indeed   like  Lin  Jian  Xing  said;  it  was  extremely  poor  with  no  sign  of  life  and  was   suitable  for  the  battle.</p>
<p>“Lin  Jian  Xing,  if  you  don’t  resist,  I  will  guarantee  with  my  life  that  your   life  will  be  preserved.”  Red  Heart  Traveler  said  with  a  sigh.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  scoffed:  ”If  someone  suddenly  intrudes  your  home  and   frames  you  for  something  you  did  not  do,  even  going  as  far  as  to  attack  you;</p>
<p>and  afterwards,  say  that  they  are  going  to  preserve  your  life,  what  will  you   do?”</p>
<p>“Why  talk  so  much!”  Red  Heart  Traveler  was  about  to  reply,  when  Wan  Zi   Hong  suddenly  attacked.</p>
<p>She  disappeared  and  appeared  behind  Lin  Jian  Xing  in  an  instant.</p>
<p>She  stabbed  at  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  back  with  her  ten  sharp,  purplish-black  nails   that  were  extremely  sharp!</p>
<p>Wan  Zi  Hong  was  a  demonic  immortal  recruited  by  Heavenly  Court,  she   did  not  lack  viciousness  and  also  had  her  own  arrogance.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  toyed  with  her  for  so  long  with  sword  qi  takes  form,  she  was   already  disgruntled.</p>
<p>Right  now,  she  still  used  flower  thorn  stab,  but  with  ten  times  the  power!</p>
<p>‘You  have  a  body  made  of  flesh  and  blood,  let  me  see  how  long  you  can   resist  this.’  Wan  Zi  Hong’s  eyes  shone  with  a  ferocious  light.</p>
<p>However,  at  the  next  moment,  there  was  a  thunderous  explosion.</p>
<p>By  the  time  Wan  Zi  Hong  reacted,  she  found  she  had  already  flown  far   away.  She  could  only  see  the  back  figure  of  Lin  Jian  Xing  who  had  been  so   close  to  her,  and  because  of  the  long  distance,  he  was  as  small  as  her  palm.</p>
<p>“What  happened?  What  killer  move  is  this?”  Wan  Zi  Hong  just  had  this   thought  when  an  intense  pain  assaulted  her.</p>
<p>Guh.</p>
<p>She  coughed  out  blood  and  found  to  her  horror  that  her  defense  killer  move   was  almost  destroyed  completely.</p>
<p>“What  in  the  world  was  that  move?!”  The  other  Heavenly  Court  Gu   Immortals  were  also  extremely  shocked.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  method  was  too  fast,  the  Heavenly  Court  immortals  did  not   see  it  clearly.</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin  quickly  retreated  and  pulled  some  distance  apart.</p>
<p>Nine  Spiritual  Fairy,  however,  transformed  into  an  immemorial  desolate   beast  once  again  and  attacked  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>Under  this  situation,  the  sturdy  and  tough  transformation  path  Gu  Immortal   was  the  best  choice  to  probe  the  enemy.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>However,  with  a  thunderous  explosion,  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  was  also  sent   flying.</p>
<p>Three  of  her  ribs  were  broken  at  the  very  least.</p>
<p>This  time,  the  other  Heavenly  Court  Gu  Immortals  were  able  to  barely  see   the  killer  move.  This  was  a  sword  path  killer  move,  it  was  formed  from   sword  qi  and  was  so  fast  that  it  was  almost  impossible  to  catch  it  with  naked   eyes.</p>
<p>Even  with  investigative  methods,  they  were  only  able  to  barely  see  it.</p>
<p>“This  move  is  called  sword  qi  lightning  roar,  please  appraise  it.”  Lin  Jian   Xing  said  before  counterattacking.</p>
<p>Bam  bam  bam…</p>
<p>Thunderous  explosions  rang  again  and  again,  the  five  Heavenly  Court   immortals  were  actually  forced  back.</p>
<p>Naturally,  Lin  Jian  Xing  did  not  use  just  his  sword  qi  lightning  roar  killer   move,  he  occasionally  used  sword  qi  takes  form  as  well.</p>
<p>Sword  qi  takes  form  killer  move  was  exquisite  and  profound,  while  sword   qi  lightning  roar  was  fast,  it  was  extremely  fast!</p>
<p>So  fast  that  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  could  not  even  see  it   properly;  for  a  while,  they  could  only  use  defensive  methods  to  resist.</p>
<p>“Lin  Jian  Xing  actually  had  such  methods!  Protect  me.”  Zhou  Xiong  Xin   secretly  transmitted  his  voice.</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  immediately  flew  in  front  of  him  and  activated  majestic   blood  light.</p>
<p>The  blood  light  was  like  a  sphere  that  completely  covered  Red  Heart   Traveler  and  Zhou  Xiong  Xin.</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin  had  just  prepared  his  method  for  a  few  breaths  of  time   when  Lin  Jian  Xing  sensed  it.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  pointed  at  the  blood  sphere;  in  an  instant,  at  least  three  sword   qi  lightning  roar  attacked,  rapidly  destroying  the  blood  sphere.</p>
<p>But  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  laughed  loudly:  ”You  fell  for  it.”</p>
<p>He  had  already  finished  preparing  and  was  only  intentionally  delaying  to   create  a  deception  of  activating  a  powerful  killer  move  that  needed  a  long   period  of  time  to  activate.</p>
<p>After  all,  a  killer  move  with  longer  activation  time  was  often  more   powerful.</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin  cultivated  information  path,  he  activated  the  move  but  it   could  not  attack  actively.  However,  if  the  enemy  used  a  killer  move  and  was</p>
<p>blocked  by  this  move,  it  could  capture  the  information  about  the  enemy’s   killer  move  and  give  a  warning  to  Zhou  Xiong  Xin.</p>
<p>Zhou  Xiong  Xin  received  early  warnings,  he  quickly  used  information  path   methods  to  share  the  effect  with  the  other  four  immortals.</p>
<p>The  battle  situation  had  a  clear  change.</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  finally  stabilized  their  footing  and   began  to  exchange  attacks  with  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  sword  qi  lightning  roar  killer  move  was  extremely  fast,  it   would  hit  the  target  before  they  could  even  react.</p>
<p>But  Lin  Jian  Xing  still  required  time  to  activate  this  killer  move. Zhou   Xiong  Xin’s  information  path  killer  move  would  give  early  warnings  to   Zhou  Xiong  Xin  and  the  rest  when  Lin  Jian  Xing  started  preparing  sword  qi   lightning  roar  killer  move.</p>
<p>Adding  on  this  little  time,  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  were  barely   able  to  react.</p>
<p>Both  sides  fought  intensely  but  the  Heavenly  Court  immortals  were  actually   unable  to  grasp  the  control  of  the  situation  and  were  still  being  suppressed   by  Lin  Jian  Xing.</p>
<p>“How  is  this  possible?”</p>
<p>“He  is  actually  so  strong?  This  does  not  match  the  intel  we  have.”</p>
<p>“Sword  qi  lightning  roar  and  sword  qi  takes  form  are  already  brilliant   moves,  his  combat  awareness  is  even  better,  far  surpassing  mine.”</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  immortals  were  inwardly  shaken.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  did  not  just  rely  on  the  two  moves  to  dominate  them,  he   showed  his  terrifying  strength  as  well.</p>
<p>There  was  no  strongest  Gu  worm,  there  was  no  most  powerful  killer  move,   but  there  was  always  a  strongest  Gu  Immortal.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  was  nowhere  near  number  one  but  he  vaguely  surpassed  the   five  Heavenly  Court  immortals.</p>
<p>“Our  paths  are  different  and  impede  each  other.  This  will  not  do!”</p>
<p>“Lin  Jian  Xing  has  such  battle  strength,  he  needs  to  be  weakened  for  us  to   have  the  chance  of  using  rumor  cage  killer  move.”</p>
<p>“Let  me  try!”</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  discussed  quickly  as  Prince  Feng  Xian   stood  up.</p>
<p>He  sent  out  lumps  of  sparks  which  covered  the  battlefield  in  just  a  few   moments.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  surging  sword  qi  were  actually  burned  by  the  sparks  and   whittled  down  rapidly.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  was  momentarily  stunned,  his  vital  Immortal  Gu  was  rank   eight  Immortal  Gu  Sword  Qi.  Be  it  sword  qi  takes  form  or  sword  qi   lightning  roar,  they  both  used  Sword  Qi  as  the  foundation.</p>
<p>Prince  Feng  Xian’s  move  actually  burned  his  sword  qi  which  broke  his   battle  foundation.</p>
<p>At  least  half  of  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  sword  qi  were  burned;  in  an  instant,  his   strength  fell  rapidly.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  immortals  used  this  chance  to  counterattack.</p>
<p>After  several  exchanges,  an  opportunity  appeared  which  was  grasped  by   Nine  Spiritual  Fairy.</p>
<p>Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  turned  into  a  willow  tree,  its  branches  coiled  around   Lin  Jian  Xing  like  a  python  and  bound  him  to  the  trunk.</p>
<p>Using  this  chance,  Zhou  Xiong  Xin  quickly  used  rumor  cage  battlefield   killer  move.</p>
<p>Seeing  that  Lin  Jian  Xing  had  fallen  into  the  battlefield  killer  move  once   again,  the  five  immortals’  spirits  rose.</p>
<p>But  at  the  next  moment,  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  let  out  a  painful  cry.  Her   willow  tree  immemorial  desolate  beast  form  disappeared  as  she  returned  to   her  human  form.  She  retreated  in  panic  with  her  whole  body  covered  in   blood.</p>
<p>“What  happened  this  time?!”  The  other  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals   were  astonished.</p>
<p>“Careful!!”  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  was  shielded  by  Zhou  Xiong  Xin,  her   expression  was  still  full  of  shock  along  with  a  trace  of  fear.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  got  rid  of  the  bindings  and  smiled,  his  aura  rising  slowly.</p>
<p>The  Heavenly  Court  immortals  turned  pale  when  they  sensed  this  aura.</p>
<p>Pseudo  venerable!</p>
<p>“He  concealed  it  really  well.”</p>
<p>“He  is  actually  a  pseudo  venerable!”</p>
<p>At  this  point,  Lin  Jian  Xing  finally  showed  his  full  strength.</p>
<p>Translucent  milky  white  strings  emerged  around  him.</p>
<p>The  strings  flew  towards  Heavenly  Court  immortals  with  an  extremely  fast   speed.</p>
<p>Sword  path  killer  move  —  Sword  Qi  Threads!</p>
<p>“It  was  this  move!”  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  reminded.</p>
<p>The  other  four  Heavenly  Court  immortals  were  solemn,  transformation  path   Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  transformed  into  an  immemorial  desolate  plant  but  was   beaten  miserably  by  this  move,  they  naturally  could  not  treat  this  lightly.</p>
<p>Red  Heart  Traveler  activated  all  of  his  defensive  methods  as  he  took  the   lead  in  facing  these  threads.</p>
<p>The  threads  had  extreme  sharpness  that  could  not  be  expressed  in  words.   They  directly  cut  straight  through,  Red  Heart  Traveler  might  have  been  cut   into  pieces  by  the  threads  if  he  had  not  reacted  fast  enough  and  pulled  apart   some  distance  immediately.</p>
<p>“This  move  cannot  be  blocked!”  The  other  three  Heavenly  Court  immortals   also  probed  the  power  of  this  move  and  reached  a  consensus.</p>
<p>The  threads’  sharpness  was  unimaginable,  even  the  powerful  Heavenly   Court  immortals  could  only  flee  and  evade.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing  did  not  move,  he  sent  out  more  and  more  threads  that   gradually  filled  the  whole  battlefield.</p>
<p>The  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals  made  an  awkward  discovery,  the   battlefield  they  wanted  to  trap  Lin  Jian  Xing  in  became  an  obstruction  for   their  own  dodging  attempts.</p>
<p>They  finally  realized  now  that  Lin  Jian  Xing  changed  the  battlefield  not  to   stall  for  time.  The  reason  why  he  returned  the  Immortal  Gu  was  because  he   believed  he  could  fight  all  five  of  them  alone,  he  fight  the  five  Heavenly   Court  immortals  head-on!</p>
<p>“Lin  Jian  Xing!  You  are  really  underestimating  us!”</p>
<p>“Cancel  rumor  cage,  let  me  activate  my  strongest  method!”</p>
<p>“No,  let  me  go  first.”</p>
<p>Facing  such  a  powerful  Lin  Jian  Xing,  the  five  Heavenly  Court  immortals   decisively  canceled  rumor  cage  and  used  their  strongest  killer  moves.</p>
<p>Lin  Jian  Xing’s  smile  did  not  go  away  as  he  activated  another  method.</p>
<p>In  an  instant,  sword  light  flew  everywhere.</p>
<p>Sword  path  killer  move  —  Sword  Light  Disintegration!</p>
<p>Bam  bam  bam…</p>
<p>In  this  battle,  Lin  Jian  Xing  won  against  five  opponents  alone.  He  killed   Wan  Zi  Hong,  severely  injured  Zhou  Xiong  Xin,  Prince  Feng  Xian,  and  Red   Heart  Traveler,  while  Nine  Spiritual  Fairy  who  shielded  their  retreat  was   captured.</p>
<p>After  this  battle,  Lin  Jian  Xing’s  name  shook  the  five  regions.</p>
